# Explanations to Support Reflective Assessment of Videos on Controversial Topics

This repository contains:
 * 960 [videos](https://github.com/oana-inel/Explanations-ReflectionTriggers-Videos/blob/master/data/video_dataset_all_topics.csv) on three controversial topics, such as "Vaccination", "Free Trade", and "Catalonia Independence", which are machine annotated with key concepts extracted from video subtitles, their sentiment (negative, neutral, positive) and emotions (fear, joy, sadness, disgust, anger);
 * 137,951 [user comments](https://github.com/oana-inel/Explanations-ReflectionTriggers-Videos/blob/master/data/video_comments) on the 960 videos, which are machine annotated with key concepts extracted from video subtitles, their sentiment (negative, neutral, positive) and emotions (fear, joy, sadness, disgust, anger);
 * 960 [explanations based on reflection triggers](https://github.com/oana-inel/Explanations-ReflectionTriggers-Videos/blob/master/data/reflection_triggers_video_dataset.csv) (one explanation per video)
 * user-centered evaluation of the effectiveness and quality of the generated explanations to support reflective assessments of socially-driven online content; ([AMT study](https://github.com/oana-inel/Explanations-ReflectionTriggers-Videos/blob/master/user_study/) with 9 videos)


## User Studies

To investigate the influence of reflective triggers in natural language explanations on human assessment of online videos on controversial topics, we ran a between-subjects user study.
