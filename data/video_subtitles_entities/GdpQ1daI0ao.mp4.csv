Watch this week's video for a straight-forward run-down of the events surrounding the Catalonian independence vote in October 2017. 
I briefly cover off:

- The aftermath of the Referendum
- How it differs in comparison to the Scottish Referendum in 2014

Watch this week's video for a straight-forward run-down of the events surrounding the Catalonian independence vote in October 2017. 
I briefly cover off:
- What the relationship is between Catalonia and Spain
- A few reasons which might help to explain why many Catalans want independence
- What happened with the Catalonian Independence Referendum
- The aftermath of the Referendum
- How it differs in comparison to the Scottish Referendum in 2014

I hope it helps! 

Video recorded in November 2017, apologies if examples/anecdotes seem out of date in future months. Politics moves quick!
