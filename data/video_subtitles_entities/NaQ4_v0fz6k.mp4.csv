Tensions are rising in Catalonia. An independence referendum is planned for October 1st and if the majority vote Yes the Catalan government says it will declare independence from Spain.

Raul Romeva is a member of the Catalan parliament, which favours independence. A parliament set on a collision course with the Spanish government.

Xavier Albiol is the leader of the Catalan branch of Spain's ruling People's Party. His party fiercely opposes the referendum that has been deemed illegal by the Spanish constitutional court. Police have raided Catalan government offices, seized ballot papers, and arrested at least 12 officials in a bid to stop the vote.

Catalonia has been part of Spain since the country first emerged as a unified kingdom in 1469. Famous for its spectacular human towers, a tradition dating back to the 18th century, Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest regions incorporating the tourist hub of Barcelona and a thriving manufacturing industry. It already enjoys more self-government than almost any other European region.

So why are many Catalans discontented with their lot?

Tensions are rising in Catalonia. An independence referendum is planned for October 1st and if the majority vote Yes the Catalan government says it will declare independence from Spain.

Raul Romeva is a member of the Catalan parliament, which favours independence. A parliament set on a collision course with the Spanish government.

Xavier Albiol is the leader of the Catalan branch of Spain's ruling People's Party. His party fiercely opposes the referendum that has been deemed illegal by the Spanish constitutional court. Police have raided Catalan government offices, seized ballot papers, and arrested at least 12 officials in a bid to stop the vote.

Catalonia has been part of Spain since the country first emerged as a unified kingdom in 1469. Famous for its spectacular human towers, a tradition dating back to the 18th century, Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest regions incorporating the tourist hub of Barcelona and a thriving manufacturing industry. It already enjoys more self-government than almost any other European region.

So why are many Catalans discontented with their lot?

Tensions are rising in Catalonia. An independence referendum is planned for October 1st and if the majority vote Yes the Catalan government says it will declare independence from Spain.

Raul Romeva is a member of the Catalan parliament, which favours independence. A parliament set on a collision course with the Spanish government.

Xavier Albiol is the leader of the Catalan branch of Spain's ruling People's Party. His party fiercely opposes the referendum that has been deemed illegal by the Spanish constitutional court. Police have raided Catalan government offices, seized ballot papers, and arrested at least 12 officials in a bid to stop the vote.

Catalonia has been part of Spain since the country first emerged as a unified kingdom in 1469. Famous for its spectacular human towers, a tradition dating back to the 18th century, Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest regions incorporating the tourist hub of Barcelona and a thriving manufacturing industry. It already enjoys more self-government than almost any other European region.

So why are many Catalans discontented with their lot?
