It stops them suffering from diseases that can be fatal. Vaccine side effects are one of the hot topics at the moment in both human and pet health. What are the real risks of vaccination in dogs and cats?

No, vaccines do not cause autism in dogs, cats or people. If you really believe a Dr who has been struck off for falsifying research data then I can't help you!

Vaccines do come with some risks however. Most are mild, nothing more than the body reacting to a perceived infection. There is though a very small chance of more serious side effects that you should be aware of such as anaphylactic reaction and injection site tumor.

It's important not to overexaggerate the risks of these though when the risk of not vaccinating is certainly much much greater for the vast majority of pet dogs and cats.
