 People celebrate the independence declaration in Catalonia
 - Catalan parliament declares independence from Spain - Catalan parliament votes to start 'constituent process' to split from Spain - Catalans declare independence as Madrid imposes direct rule - 
 Catalan Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favor of declaring independence from Spain - Catalonia Passes Motion for Independence from Spain - Catalonia independence live updates - Catalonia live updates -  catalonia independence live -  Catalonia live webcam - katalonien unabhängigkeit live - katalonien unabhängigkeit von Spanien - Katalonien Regionalparlament stimmt für Unabhängigkeitserklärung - The Catalan Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favor of declaring independence from Spain on Friday, taking the country's deepening political crisis into uncharted territory.
The vote brought to a head a weeks-long standoff with Madrid that began with a disputed referendum on October 1, and came as the Spanish Senate approved the Madrid government's unprecedented plans to seize control of the autonomous region.
The Spanish government is now expected to begin moves at the weekend to remove from office the Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and his ministers, and impose direct rule from Madrid. Lawmakers voted in secret in the Catalan Parliament chamber after a heated debate on a motion ""to form the Catalan Republic as an independent and sovereign state.""
The outcome: 70 votes in favor, 10 against and two blanks. Opposition lawmakers walked out of the chamber ahead of the vote. Pro-independence crowds massed outside the Parliament cheered and waved the Catalan ""Estelada"" separatist flag as the result was announced. Within minutes, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy tweeted an appeal for calm. ""I ask all Spaniards to remain calm. The rule of law will restore legality in Catalonia,"" he said.
The two parliamentary sessions were the culmination of a weeks-long standoff, which began on October 1 when Catalonia defied Madrid and held a banned referendum on independence, plunging Spain into its worst political crisis since the restoration of democracy in the 1970s. Hopes for a resolution were dashed Thursday when Puigdemont backed away from a plan to call new elections himself, amid disagreement within his own party and pressure from opposing sides. Hopes for a resolution were dashed Thursday when Puigdemont backed away from a plan to call new elections himself, amid disagreement within his own party and pressure from opposing sides.
 Speaking in the Catalan Parliament building after the landmark vote, Puigdemont said legitimately elected lawmakers had cast their ballots according to a mandate earned in the October 1 referendum.
But he acknowledged that the path ahead would not be easy. ""We are facing a period in which we will need to stay strong and in peace, dignified and civil as we have always been, and I'm sure we will keep being so,"" he said.
""The institutions and the people together built nations, societies, and a nation cannot be built without one of these elements.""
Supporters followed his words with applause and repeated chants of ""freedom, freedom."" Source: CNN
