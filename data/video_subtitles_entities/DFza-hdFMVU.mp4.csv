Hundreds of supporters of Catalan independence gathered in the central Placa del Vi square in Girona, in front of the city hall, to follow the vote of the Catalan parliament and to call for the release of imprisoned activists Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez. Numerous pro-Catalan independence flags (known as ‘Estreladas’) dotted the square and the crowd erupted in celebrations once the voting results came in.
