Well, kind of but not really!

The only country that comes close to the definition of a closed economy at this point (as you're about to find out in the video) is still not at 100% when it comes to autarky, with it engaging in some form of international trade... even if not on a huge scale.

Could other countries choose to embrace autarky?

In theory, sure. Practically speaking however, while some countries do decide to go with autarky-inspired policies when it comes to certain key industries... the economics are just not there when it comes to the closed economy equation as a whole.

Through this video, autarky as well as free trade have been defined, explained and compared. Through an easy-to-understand explanation as well as well-chosen examples, you'll understand why free trade is without a doubt the dominant force at this point, whereas autarky and closed economies are good topics for geopolitics classes... but that's pretty much it :)
