The trade deal, which has been fifteen years in the making, was signed during Poroshenko's 30-hour visit to Israel. It is expected to boost trade between the two countries to over US$1 billion [€880 billion] annually within five years.

""This is a historic day in the relations between Israel and Ukraine and a historic day because of the absolute removal all the barriers in our economic ties. And I want to congratulate you and thank you for this effective co-operation,"" Poroshenko said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also spoke on the issue of missile strike targeting Iranian positions in Damascus early on Monday morning, after an Iranian missile was fired from Syrian territory.

""Israel will continue to block Iran's efforts to use Syria, Lebanon and Gaza as forward bases for attacking Israel for the express purpose which they openly declare - destroying Israel. No country should stand aside while its destruction is being planned or advanced and Israel exercises its basic right of self-defence and pre-emptive self-defence,"" he said.
