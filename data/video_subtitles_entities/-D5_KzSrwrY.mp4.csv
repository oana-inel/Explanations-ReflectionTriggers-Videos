It’s a new dawn for Africa as 44 leaders of AU member states have signed the Continental Free Trade Agreement which opens a 1.2 billion people market to each of the nations once ratified.  

But the two biggest economies, Nigeria and South Africa, however, did not sign up. It is still not clear why the two countries stayed on the sidelines. Others staying out of the continental trading bloc are Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Zambia, Burundi, Eritrea, Benin, Sierra Leone and Guinea Bissau. The project needed a minimum of 22 countries signing up to get off the ground, which was achieved.
