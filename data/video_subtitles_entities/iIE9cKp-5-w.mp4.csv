The strike was called to protest alleged brutality by police forces that tried to stop a referendum on the region's secession from Spain that left hundreds of people injured.
The strike call came as regional authorities and political parties studied a possible declaration of independence this week following the referendum that Spain said was illegal and invalid.
Port workers were being called to demonstrate on Tuesday outside the regional headquarters of Spain's ruling Popular Party, while firefighters planned a rally outside the Interior Ministry's regional office in the Catalan capital of Barcelona.
Protests were also to be staged outside polling stations where police acted with force to try to prevent Sunday's poll being held.
