Across the region, yellow ribbons are tied to benches, traffic posts and trash cans — or painted on sidewalks, tree trunks and lamp posts.
The yellow ribbon is a symbol of protest at the imprisonment of nine high-profile separatist leaders while they await trial on charges that include rebellion, for their role in an illegal referendum and ineffective declaration of independence last year.
But the littering of town squares, bridges and streets with the yellow ribbons has given life to a counter movement drawn from the other half of Catalonia's 7.5 million residents — the ones who want to maintain centuries-old ties with the rest of Spain.
Jose Casado is the spokesman for a loosely knit network of self-proclaimed ""cleaning brigades."" They are volunteers who meet a few times a month to scour their neighborhoods and remove as many of the yellow ribbons as they can find on public property. 
They use box cutters and tree pruners to snip off the ribbons, but have a rule not to touch the pro-independence flags and banners that hang from the balconies of private homes.
""Firstly we don't believe that they are political prisoners,"" Casado, a 38-year-old boxing instructor from the coastal town of Mataro, told the AP. ""Because they tried to do a coup d'état in Catalonia. In fact, there has been a social fracture since that day"" Casado added, referring to the referendum held on October 1. 
The cleaners do their work at night, wearing full white body suits and covering their faces with hygienic masks and protective goggles, partly to conceal their identity and partly to make a statement.
Casado and other four volunteers estimate that in the first hour of work on a recent night they removed well over one thousand ribbons from part of a fence running along the coastal train tracks of a small village near Barcelona. 
Divided by ideology, the two sides nonetheless resemble one another; both groups have sprung up over the past year on a local level, driven by social media and mobile-phone messaging services.
They also share a deep sense of aggrievement — the separatists feel abused by the central government and courts; the unionists feel demonized by the regional Catalan authorities.
The cleaning brigades argue that they are filling a gap left by Catalan authorities who have allowed the supporters of secession to turn common space into an echo chamber for their ideas.
Many secessionists pin the yellow symbol on their clothes and balconies and large yellow ribbons hang from both the seat of the Catalan government and the Barcelona town hall that face one another in the center of the region's capital.
So far, ugly run-ins between adversaries have mostly produced heated debates and the exchange of verbal insults. But three people were hurt in a clash last May in the coastal town of Canet de Mar when Casado's group tried to remove a bunch of yellow crosses that pro-secession activists had planted on the beach. Both sides blamed the other for the scuffle.
Also, last month a woman filed charges with the police claiming she was hit by a man who was angry at her for removing yellow ribbons in Barcelona.
Citing these statements by Torra and other evidence, Spain's state prosecutor's office has opened a probe into the alleged identification by Catalan police of people who have removed ribbons.
