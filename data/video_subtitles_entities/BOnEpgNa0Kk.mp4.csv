Making the right choices about vaccinating your children is not an easy one and involves both individual choices and an overall plan: what are your own beliefs about what is best for your child? What are the local rules and mandates in your state that you will face? How do you want to work with your pediatrician or other health service providers? How do you want to work with day care services and the school system? Ultimately, what is the overall vaccination schedule you want to choose for your child?

Some of our friends are against vaccination on principle; we are not, but we respect their position. Like them, we support choice as the bedrock of health freedom; but that choice includes the freedom to vaccinate, and a lot of parents are going to choose to vaccinate. They should not be left without unbiased information on how to provide vaccines they choose to give their own children.

So the first thing to understand is this truly is your choice – not ours (we’re not recommending any specific schedule here), not any one doctor’s, and certainly not the government’s. This is America, after all, the land of the free and the home of the brave – which you’ll need to be as you think and act for yourselves about this fraught topic. It’s impossible to avoid hearing dire talk about “requirements,” about ”firing” parents from medical practices or expelling kids from school if they don’t follow the letter of the federal vaccine chart.

But as citizens, we still hold the keys to choices affecting our offspring, and we do not hand them over to anybody in return for the right to a public education or any other inducement. The starting point for the discussion is freedom of speech and freedom of choice, and the fact that parents are in charge when it comes to decisions involving their children as long as those decisions don’t hinder their health or wellbeing. Given the well-founded concerns we’ve demonstrated about individual vaccines – as well as the bloated childhood immunization schedule -- making careful vaccination choices hardly counts as jeopardizing kids’ health. In fact, the real threat is not stepping out of line but mindlessly toeing it, at least when your child’s wellbeing is on the line.
