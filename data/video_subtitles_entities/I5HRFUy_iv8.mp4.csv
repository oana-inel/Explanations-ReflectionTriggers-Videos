Many people assume that importing goods from other countries destroys jobs here in the U.S. IS that true?  Economists believe that trade doesn't destroy jobs, it just moves them around within the economy. The idea is that trading with other nations lowers consumer prices, and those consumers buy things they couldn't have afforded before - creating jobs to replace those lost to trade.

Many people assume that importing goods from other countries destroys jobs here in the U.S. IS that true?  Economists believe that trade doesn't destroy jobs, it just moves them around within the economy. The idea is that trading with other nations lowers consumer prices, and those consumers buy things they couldn't have afforded before - creating jobs to replace those lost to trade.
