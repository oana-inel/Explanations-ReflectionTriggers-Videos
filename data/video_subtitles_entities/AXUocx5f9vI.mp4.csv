However, these agreements continue to be referred to and legitimized (or critiqued) as “free trade agreements.” Consequently, the economic effects of the stronger IP rights — which are actually a form of protectionism — in these agreements, tend to be glossed over.

In this video, Blayne Haggart argues that referring to the TPP and similar next-generation trade agreements improperly as free trade agreements can lead policy makers to ignore the ways in which the world has changed and to underplay the long-term importance of parts of the agreement — in particular, those related to IP — that do not fall neatly into the free trade world view.",Centre for International Governance Innovation,"trade', 'intellectual property', 'NAFTA', 'TPP', 'CIGI', 'Blayne Haggart', 'innovation', 'Canada'",PT3M16S,196,4
