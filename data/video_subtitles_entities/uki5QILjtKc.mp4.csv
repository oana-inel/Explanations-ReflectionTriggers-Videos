With vaccines, we take advantage of one of the most important aspects of the immune system - the ability to develop immunological memory. This means, that once the person or animal is exposed to a particular pathogen, in other words anything that can cause an illness, they will develop resistance to infection with the same pathogen in the future.

By taking advantage of immunological memory, vaccination prevents and controls the spread of a wide range of illnesses, including polio, smallpox, whooping cough, measles and the seasonal influenza virus.
