Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy earlier told senators direct rule was needed to return ""law, democracy and stability"" to Catalonia.
The crisis began when Catalans backed independence in a disputed vote earlier this month.

It would enable Madrid to fire Catalan leaders, and take control of the region's finances, police and public media.
