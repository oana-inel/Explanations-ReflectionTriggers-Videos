In response, Mr Johnson said it would be similar to Switzerland’s relationship with the European Union.

Switzerland is not part of the EU however it has signed up to a plethora of agreements and directives including free movement of people.

“There are examples of just-in-time supply chains that operate with a high-degree of efficiency over customs union differentials – there is no reason why that can’t be done”, he said.

“That should not be an obstacle to us properly taking back control, delivering what the British people voted for and doing great free-trade deals and seizing back control of our destiny.”

“The Chequers proposals manifestly fail to do that”, Mr Johnson added.
