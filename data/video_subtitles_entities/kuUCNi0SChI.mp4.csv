Free trade agreements are designed to improve business links with important partners around the world. In addition to the EFTA agreement and the free trade agreement with the European Union, Switzerland currently has a network of 28 free trade agreements, and new agreements are continually being negotiated.
Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) make life easier, because they minimize or eliminate barriers to international markets. The essential component of every agreement is trade in merchandise, which reduces or eliminates customs duties and other trade restrictions. Trade and unprocessed agricultural products tend to be regulated at separated agricultural agreements. There are also so-called second generation agreements. These include the protection of intellectual property rights, trade and services, investments, public procurement and technical regulations. Did you know that no other country has as large a network of FTAs as Switzerland has? In 2012 trade with only five important EU countries resulted in duty savings of 1 billion Swiss francs. Did you also know that 51 % of Switzerland's exports to markets outside the EU are realized through FTA? FTA offers several benefits. Most important, they promote the growth, added value and competitiveness of Switzerland as a business location. Swiss exporters and importers benefit from the savings in customs duties. Here's an example of an FTA's benefits: let's say you are the export manager of a Swiss manufacturer of dishwashers. Your company is only active in Europe and you want to export to China. So you call the experts at Switzerland Global Enterprise. We are pleased to inform you that you can save up to 14 % in customs duties for your dishwasher if it meets the specific rules of origin of the FTA between Switzerland and China. In this example, the value criterion allows a maximum share of 50 % by a third country. Remember: your European competitor pays 14 % in custom expenses as long as the EU doesn't have an FTA with China. Let's say your merchandise value is 100000 Swiss francs: this means with an FTA you save 14000 Swiss francs in customs duties. And it's easy! Your company creates a proof of origin and ships the goods to China. The result? You are happy because your Chinese client is happy, and we are happy to help you. Switzerland Global Enterprise offers a wide range of support measures, events, online tools, expert database, studies and fact sheets, customs tariffs worldwide and our FTA map for the best overview.

Free trade agreements are designed to improve business links with important partners around the world. In addition to the EFTA agreement and the free trade agreement with the European Union, Switzerland currently has a network of 28 free trade agreements, and new agreements are continually being negotiated.
Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) make life easier, because they minimize or eliminate barriers to international markets. The essential component of every agreement is trade in merchandise, which reduces or eliminates customs duties and other trade restrictions. Trade and unprocessed agricultural products tend to be regulated at separated agricultural agreements. There are also so-called second generation agreements. These include the protection of intellectual property rights, trade and services, investments, public procurement and technical regulations. Did you know that no other country has as large a network of FTAs as Switzerland has? In 2012 trade with only five important EU countries resulted in duty savings of 1 billion Swiss francs. Did you also know that 51 % of Switzerland's exports to markets outside the EU are realized through FTA? FTA offers several benefits. Most important, they promote the growth, added value and competitiveness of Switzerland as a business location. Swiss exporters and importers benefit from the savings in customs duties. Here's an example of an FTA's benefits: let's say you are the export manager of a Swiss manufacturer of dishwashers. Your company is only active in Europe and you want to export to China. So you call the experts at Switzerland Global Enterprise. We are pleased to inform you that you can save up to 14 % in customs duties for your dishwasher if it meets the specific rules of origin of the FTA between Switzerland and China. In this example, the value criterion allows a maximum share of 50 % by a third country. Remember: your European competitor pays 14 % in custom expenses as long as the EU doesn't have an FTA with China. Let's say your merchandise value is 100000 Swiss francs: this means with an FTA you save 14000 Swiss francs in customs duties. And it's easy! Your company creates a proof of origin and ships the goods to China. The result? You are happy because your Chinese client is happy, and we are happy to help you. Switzerland Global Enterprise offers a wide range of support measures, events, online tools, expert database, studies and fact sheets, customs tariffs worldwide and our FTA map for the best overview.
