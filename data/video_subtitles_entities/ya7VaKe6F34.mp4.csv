The Democrat-led Senate and Assembly voted Thursday to repeal the exemption, which allows parents of children to cite their religious beliefs to opt a child out of the vaccines required for school enrollment.

Soon after, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the measure.

Similar exemptions are allowed in 46 states, though lawmakers in several of them are also considering the elimination of the waiver.

""We are facing an unprecedented public health crisis,"" said Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan and the sponsor of the legislation in the Senate. ""The atrocious peddlers of junk science and fraudulent medicine who we know as anti-vaxxers have spent years sowing unwarranted doubt and fear, but it is time for legislators to confront them head on.""

Hundreds of parents of unvaccinated children gathered at New York's Capitol before the vote to protest what several called an assault on religious freedom.

The Democrat-led Senate and Assembly voted Thursday to repeal the exemption, which allows parents of children to cite their religious beliefs to opt a child out of the vaccines required for school enrollment.

Soon after, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the measure.

Similar exemptions are allowed in 46 states, though lawmakers in several of them are also considering the elimination of the waiver.

""We are facing an unprecedented public health crisis,"" said Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan and the sponsor of the legislation in the Senate. ""The atrocious peddlers of junk science and fraudulent medicine who we know as anti-vaxxers have spent years sowing unwarranted doubt and fear, but it is time for legislators to confront them head on.""

Hundreds of parents of unvaccinated children gathered at New York's Capitol before the vote to protest what several called an assault on religious freedom.
