Fernando Vallespin, Professor of political studies in Madrid's Autonomous University, pointed out that the Catalan government had wanted a popular vote and had convinced the Catalan population that it was the right move, but that in fact, the right thing would have been to ""keep the law."" 
Vallespin spoke as Catalan separatists called for international mediation with the Spanish government as they pushed ahead with plans to declare unilateral independence this week after a violent police crackdown scarred a disputed secession referendum.
The referendum debacle only deepened Spain's most serious political crisis since democratic rule was restored in 1978.
The violence on Sunday in the prosperous northeastern region left more than 890 civilians and 430 police injured when anti-riot squads moved into polling stations and dispersed voters.
Shocking videos and photos of police dragging people by the hair and kicking them were flashed around the globe, leading some European leaders to warn about any further escalation of violence.
Spain is now considering the possible implementation of Article 155 of the country's constitution, which allows the government to suspend, totally or partially, the self-government of any region if it disobeys its constitutional obligations or attacks the general interests of Spain. 
Catalonia would first be warned and if it didn't rectify, the measures decided upon would be put to the Senate for approval, a simple matter for Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy as his party has a majority. 
Vallespin believes Article 155 could take around a week to implement, although it would need to be negotiated with the opposition.
The referendum fiasco brought Spain and Catalonia closer to a potentially disastrous showdown as each side said Sunday's events proved them right.
Rajoy met on Monday with his conservative Popular Party members before seeking a parliamentary session to discuss how to confront Spain's most serious political crisis in decades. 
He also met with the leaders of the opposition Socialist and Citizens parties to discuss Spain's options, although no immediate consensus emerged.
Vallespin compared Sunday's ballot with the recent referendum for Scottish independence in the UK, but says the situation is fundamentally different because the UK, unlike Spain, has parliamentary sovereignty and no written constitution.
Catalan officials say an overwhelming majority of the 2.26 million who voted supported independence from Spain - they said 90 percent - but the central government in Madrid has repeatedly condemned the referendum as unconstitutional and invalid.
The Catalan president said the regional parliament will be asked to declare independence this week after final results are announced - and plenary sessions are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.

Fernando Vallespin, Professor of political studies in Madrid's Autonomous University, pointed out that the Catalan government had wanted a popular vote and had convinced the Catalan population that it was the right move, but that in fact, the right thing would have been to ""keep the law."" 
Vallespin spoke as Catalan separatists called for international mediation with the Spanish government as they pushed ahead with plans to declare unilateral independence this week after a violent police crackdown scarred a disputed secession referendum.
The referendum debacle only deepened Spain's most serious political crisis since democratic rule was restored in 1978.
The violence on Sunday in the prosperous northeastern region left more than 890 civilians and 430 police injured when anti-riot squads moved into polling stations and dispersed voters.
Shocking videos and photos of police dragging people by the hair and kicking them were flashed around the globe, leading some European leaders to warn about any further escalation of violence.
Spain is now considering the possible implementation of Article 155 of the country's constitution, which allows the government to suspend, totally or partially, the self-government of any region if it disobeys its constitutional obligations or attacks the general interests of Spain. 
Catalonia would first be warned and if it didn't rectify, the measures decided upon would be put to the Senate for approval, a simple matter for Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy as his party has a majority. 
Vallespin believes Article 155 could take around a week to implement, although it would need to be negotiated with the opposition.
The referendum fiasco brought Spain and Catalonia closer to a potentially disastrous showdown as each side said Sunday's events proved them right.
Rajoy met on Monday with his conservative Popular Party members before seeking a parliamentary session to discuss how to confront Spain's most serious political crisis in decades. 
He also met with the leaders of the opposition Socialist and Citizens parties to discuss Spain's options, although no immediate consensus emerged.
Vallespin compared Sunday's ballot with the recent referendum for Scottish independence in the UK, but says the situation is fundamentally different because the UK, unlike Spain, has parliamentary sovereignty and no written constitution.
Catalan officials say an overwhelming majority of the 2.26 million who voted supported independence from Spain - they said 90 percent - but the central government in Madrid has repeatedly condemned the referendum as unconstitutional and invalid.
The Catalan president said the regional parliament will be asked to declare independence this week after final results are announced - and plenary sessions are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.
