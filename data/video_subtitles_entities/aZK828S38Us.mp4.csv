Jessica Biel is speaking out after she received backlash for her meetings with anti-vaccination advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. I am not against vaccinations,"" Biel wrote on Instagram Thursday. ""I support children getting vaccinations and I also support families having the right to make educated medical decisions for their children alongside their physicians."" Biel explained her concerns with SB 276, a California bill that seeks to limit medical exemptions for vaccinations. “My dearest friends have a child with a medical condition that warrants an exemption from vaccinations, and should this bill pass, it would greatly affect their family's ability to care for their child in this state,"" Biel's post continued. 

Daniel Radcliffe has joined the cast of The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt interactive special coming to Netflix in 2020. Little is known about the part the Harry Potter star will play, but the special sees Kimmy set off on her biggest adventure yet, taking her to three different states.

Cuba Gooding Jr. surrendered to the NYPD for questioning on Thursday. The Oscar winner was charged with forcible touching, a misdemeanor, relating to an alleged groping incident last weekend. His attorney Mark Heller said at a press conference , ""Mr. Gooding has not acted inappropriately in any shape or form.” He added “I, frankly, am shocked and horrified that this case is being prosecuted.""
