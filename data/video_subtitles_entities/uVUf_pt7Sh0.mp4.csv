*SOME vaccines are contraindicated DURING pregnancy, which is why pregnant women can be a vulnerable population for some diseases if they lack immunity [mentioned when discussing herd immunity].

Keep in mind that, as the note states in the video, a woman may be vaccinated against rubella as a child but find out when pregnant that she has a ""low titer"" of Rubella antibodies and therefore be vulnerable. As the note mentions, some vaccines require ""booster"" doses.

The Amoeba Sisters videos demystify science with humor and relevance. The videos center on Pinky's certification and experience in teaching science at the high school level. Pinky's teacher certification is in grades 4-8 science and 8-12 composite science (encompassing biology, chemistry, and physics).  Amoeba Sisters videos only cover concepts that Pinky is certified to teach, and they focus on her specialty: secondary life science. For more information about The Amoeba Sisters, visit: 
http://www.amoebasisters.com/about-us.html

We cover the basics in biology concepts at the secondary level. If you are looking to discover more about biology and go into depth beyond these basics, our recommended reference is the FREE, peer reviewed, open source OpenStax biology textbook: https://openstax.org/details/books/biology
