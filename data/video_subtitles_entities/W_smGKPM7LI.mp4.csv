I've made this video in collaboration with Public Health England to support the NHS and all of its hard working amazing staff this winter. 

Flu leads to hundreds of thousands of GP visits and tens of thousands of hospital stays a year. In the UK an average of 8,000 people die per year from complications of flu. Last year flu killed 15,000 people and the year before that it was 16,000 people.

Apart from protecting individual people, getting the flu vaccine helps to reduce the spread of the disease, and so reduces the chance of passing on the flu virus to other people who may be at risk of flu.

If you are eligible for the free NHS flu vaccine, let's play our part and get vaccinated to support the NHS and all of its hard working amazing staff this winter. Help spread the word to friends and family by sharing this video.

I've made this video in collaboration with Public Health England to support the NHS and all of its hard working amazing staff this winter. 

Flu leads to hundreds of thousands of GP visits and tens of thousands of hospital stays a year. In the UK an average of 8,000 people die per year from complications of flu. Last year flu killed 15,000 people and the year before that it was 16,000 people.

Apart from protecting individual people, getting the flu vaccine helps to reduce the spread of the disease, and so reduces the chance of passing on the flu virus to other people who may be at risk of flu.

If you are eligible for the free NHS flu vaccine, let's play our part and get vaccinated to support the NHS and all of its hard working amazing staff this winter. Help spread the word to friends and family by sharing this video.

WHAT IS FLU:
Flu (influenza) is a common infectious viral illness spread by coughs and sneezes. For healthy adults under the age of 65 it can be very unpleasant,  you begin to feel better within about a week.

You can catch flu all year round, but it's especially common in winter, which is why it's also known as seasonal flu.

Some of the main symptoms of flu include:

• High temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
• Extreme tiredness and weakness

Flu can make you feel so exhausted and unwell that you have to stay in bed and rest until you feel better.
