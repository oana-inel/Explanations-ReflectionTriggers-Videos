Hi friends............Welcome to abmbbs.......Today's topic is MEASLES....First up Measles is caused by Paramyxovirus which is a RNA virus.....

next, what is the incubation period of measles??it is 10 to 14days.......now if you consider this to be the timeline.....& this as the point of exposure on day 0....then.....fever occurs on day 10 & rash occurs on day 14.
But remember......the incubation period of vaccine induced measles is only 7 days...

next, the source of measles infection is from cases.... there is no carrier in measles...there is no animal reservoir too.....

the mode of transmission of measles is by air droplets

the period of communicability of measles is from 4 days before to 4 days after the appearance of rash...

the Secondary attack rate of measles is 80%

measles also shows seasonal trend every 2 to 3 yrs....and it mainly occurs in the period of january to april that is in early spring

the clinical features of measles is divided into 3 stages......the 1st stage which is the prodromal stage causes fever, coryza & nasal discharge...............in the eruptive stage dusky red coloured maculopapular rash occurs....like this.....mind you the rash begins from behind the ear....that is it has retro auricular origin.
….................................in this stage koplik spot also occurs.....like this....this one....& this one....it is a characteristic sign of measles......it occurs in the buccal mucosa opposite the 2nd molar............................finally there is the Post measles stage which is characterised by wt loss & diarrhoea.


Next, the complications of measles....otitis media is the most common complication.....& pneumonia is the most common life threatening complication....another late complication of measles is called SSPE which stands for sub acute sclerosing pan encephalitis....it is extremely rare & occurs in about 7 per million cases of measles.

Finally we come to the topic of measles vaccine....this one.........it is a live attenuated freeze dried lyophilised vaccine....i have explained the meaning of each of these words in my previous video on BCG vaccination....the link is available right here...

the measles vaccine is most commonly derived from the Edmonston zagreb strain

what is the dose?....the dose is 0.5ml given subcutaneously in the antero lateral aspect of thigh.

The diluent used is distilled water & not normal saline

the vaccine is to be stored at 2 to 8 degree celsius...

the measles vaccine is  remarkable since it not only gives a protective efficacy of 90% with just the 1st dose but also gives lifelong protection
bt it is susceptable to light & must be stored in dark vials

finally when is the measles vaccine given??......it is given exactly at 9 months age......why?.....bcz till 9 months the maternal antibodies protect the baby & any vaccination before that would be rendered ineffective by the natural antibodies acquired from the mother. 
But immunization later than 9 months means that many children will contract measles in the interval between the weaning off of the natural antibodies & the introduction of the vaccine.So the WHO expanded immunization program has recommended immunization at 9 months & india has adopted the same.

next, the source of measles infection is from cases.... there is no carrier in measles...there is no animal reservoir too.....

the mode of transmission of measles is by air droplets

the period of communicability of measles is from 4 days before to 4 days after the appearance of rash...

the Secondary attack rate of measles is 80%

measles also shows seasonal trend every 2 to 3 yrs....and it mainly occurs in the period of january to april that is in early spring

the clinical features of measles is divided into 3 stages......the 1st stage which is the prodromal stage causes fever, coryza & nasal discharge...............in the eruptive stage dusky red coloured maculopapular rash occurs....like this.....mind you the rash begins from behind the ear....that is it has retro auricular origin.
….................................in this stage koplik spot also occurs.....like this....this one....& this one....it is a characteristic sign of measles......it occurs in the buccal mucosa opposite the 2nd molar............................finally there is the Post measles stage which is characterised by wt loss & diarrhoea.


Next, the complications of measles....otitis media is the most common complication.....& pneumonia is the most common life threatening complication....another late complication of measles is called SSPE which stands for sub acute sclerosing pan encephalitis....it is extremely rare & occurs in about 7 per million cases of measles.

Finally we come to the topic of measles vaccine....this one.........it is a live attenuated freeze dried lyophilised vaccine....i have explained the meaning of each of these words in my previous video on BCG vaccination....the link is available right here...

the measles vaccine is most commonly derived from the Edmonston zagreb strain

what is the dose?....the dose is 0.5ml given subcutaneously in the antero lateral aspect of thigh.

The diluent used is distilled water & not normal saline

the vaccine is to be stored at 2 to 8 degree celsius...

the measles vaccine is  remarkable since it not only gives a protective efficacy of 90% with just the 1st dose but also gives lifelong protection
bt it is susceptable to light & must be stored in dark vials

finally when is the measles vaccine given??......it is given exactly at 9 months age......why?.....bcz till 9 months the maternal antibodies protect the baby & any vaccination before that would be rendered ineffective by the natural antibodies acquired from the mother. 
But immunization later than 9 months means that many children will contract measles in the interval between the weaning off of the natural antibodies & the introduction of the vaccine.So the WHO expanded immunization program has recommended immunization at 9 months & india has adopted the same.

the measles vaccine is  remarkable since it not only gives a protective efficacy of 90% with just the 1st dose but also gives lifelong protection
bt it is susceptable to light & must be stored in dark vials

finally when is the measles vaccine given??......it is given exactly at 9 months age......why?.....bcz till 9 months the maternal antibodies protect the baby & any vaccination before that would be rendered ineffective by the natural antibodies acquired from the mother. 
But immunization later than 9 months means that many children will contract measles in the interval between the weaning off of the natural antibodies & the introduction of the vaccine.So the WHO expanded immunization program has recommended immunization at 9 months & india has adopted the same.

Hi friends............Welcome to abmbbs.......Today's topic is MEASLES....First up Measles is caused by Paramyxovirus which is a RNA virus.....

next, what is the incubation period of measles??it is 10 to 14days.......now if you consider this to be the timeline.....& this as the point of exposure on day 0....then.....fever occurs on day 10 & rash occurs on day 14.
But remember......the incubation period of vaccine induced measles is only 7 days...

next, the source of measles infection is from cases.... there is no carrier in measles...there is no animal reservoir too.....

the mode of transmission of measles is by air droplets

the period of communicability of measles is from 4 days before to 4 days after the appearance of rash...

the Secondary attack rate of measles is 80%

measles also shows seasonal trend every 2 to 3 yrs....and it mainly occurs in the period of january to april that is in early spring

the clinical features of measles is divided into 3 stages......the 1st stage which is the prodromal stage causes fever, coryza & nasal discharge...............in the eruptive stage dusky red coloured maculopapular rash occurs....like this.....mind you the rash begins from behind the ear....that is it has retro auricular origin.
….................................in this stage koplik spot also occurs.....like this....this one....& this one....it is a characteristic sign of measles......it occurs in the buccal mucosa opposite the 2nd molar............................finally there is the Post measles stage which is characterised by wt loss & diarrhoea.


Next, the complications of measles....otitis media is the most common complication.....& pneumonia is the most common life threatening complication....another late complication of measles is called SSPE which stands for sub acute sclerosing pan encephalitis....it is extremely rare & occurs in about 7 per million cases of measles.

Finally we come to the topic of measles vaccine....this one.........it is a live attenuated freeze dried lyophilised vaccine....i have explained the meaning of each of these words in my previous video on BCG vaccination....the link is available right here...

the measles vaccine is most commonly derived from the Edmonston zagreb strain

what is the dose?....the dose is 0.5ml given subcutaneously in the antero lateral aspect of thigh.

The diluent used is distilled water & not normal saline

the vaccine is to be stored at 2 to 8 degree celsius...

the measles vaccine is  remarkable since it not only gives a protective efficacy of 90% with just the 1st dose but also gives lifelong protection
