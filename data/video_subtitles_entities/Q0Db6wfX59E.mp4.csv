Kishore Jayabalan explains the ideal of authentically free trade in contrast with the current protectionism of the Western nations.

""Free trade presents many challenges and opportunities to the poor. I would say that free trade, at a very short-term level, causes all kinds of disruptions. So, it looks like free trade can actually hurt the poor. But if you allow free trade and think about the economics behind free trade, what you're doing is you're allowing poor people the opportunity to engage in production and exchange with their richer neighbors. And not only are you creating an economic bond between the rich and the poor, through trade, you're creating a moral bond between the rich and the poor. We all know the experience of going to a market and getting to know a shop owner. Now, imagine if you could somehow expand that to, let's say, the city, or expand that within a country. Not only are you creating more economically-efficient systems, but you're creating a whole system of social interaction, where people feel much more involved in the lives of society and of each other.""
