The US has been measles-free for 15 years but there has been a new outbreak, which started at Disneyland in California. The theme park has been praised for its handling of the outbreak, which may have been triggered by an overseas visitor. The spread of cases across seven states and Mexico is being blamed on parents who have chosen not to give their children the MMR vaccine, due to concerns about potential side effects. No authoritative research has been published to back up claims that the vaccine may be linked to autism and bowel disease.
