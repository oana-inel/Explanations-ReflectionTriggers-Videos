In an editorial, leading Spanish daily El Pais blamed the Catalan government for Sunday's ""shameful"" events but also criticised the Spanish government for its inability to tackle the crisis since it began about seven years ago. The newspaper said the day was ""a defeat for our country.""
People in Madrid on Monday were split on the subject with some saying the central government had had no choice but to take action, while others called their actions disproportionate.
Catalonia's government will hold a closed-door Cabinet meeting on Monday to discuss the next steps in its plan to declare independence from Spain following the disputed referendum.
Regional officials say the vote, which Spain insists was illegal and invalid, shows that a majority favour secession.
The referendum debacle brought both Spain and Catalonia closer to a potentially disastrous showdown as each side said Sunday's events proved them right and neither looked prepared to cede ground.
