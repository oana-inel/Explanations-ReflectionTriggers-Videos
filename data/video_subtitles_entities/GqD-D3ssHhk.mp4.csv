Summary:
--------------
Catalonia is a nation within Spain with its own language and culture. For many years, Catalonia has been submitted to several oppressive laws that looked for Spain's homogeneity by settling a single language and centralizing power, and trying to extinct any other identity different from the Spanish one. In 1978, after fascist Franco's dictatorship, Catalonia gained a certain level of auto-government but today Spain is limiting our capacity to further administrate our justice, economy and language issues.
 
Independentism in Catalonia has been growing during the last 30 years, and many Spaniards think that Catalonia's independence is a silly thing. They argue that Catalan nationalism is a bad thing, but they never talk about Spanish nationalism, which, for them, is the only one that is good. Furthermore, being independentist does not necessarily mean being nationalist! I like being independent from other people, but that does not mean I am better than them!

Catalan independentism does not mean hating Spain: it simply looks for a better status for Catalonia, which is as legitimate as for France, Germany, Spain or any other country.

This video debates some of the arguments given against Catalonia's viability as an independent nation, and it is based on an article from Xavier Sala-i-Martin, a Catalan-American professor of economics at Columbia University.

Summary:
--------------
Catalonia is a nation within Spain with its own language and culture. For many years, Catalonia has been submitted to several oppressive laws that looked for Spain's homogeneity by settling a single language and centralizing power, and trying to extinct any other identity different from the Spanish one. In 1978, after fascist Franco's dictatorship, Catalonia gained a certain level of auto-government but today Spain is limiting our capacity to further administrate our justice, economy and language issues.
 
Independentism in Catalonia has been growing during the last 30 years, and many Spaniards think that Catalonia's independence is a silly thing. They argue that Catalan nationalism is a bad thing, but they never talk about Spanish nationalism, which, for them, is the only one that is good. Furthermore, being independentist does not necessarily mean being nationalist! I like being independent from other people, but that does not mean I am better than them!

Catalan independentism does not mean hating Spain: it simply looks for a better status for Catalonia, which is as legitimate as for France, Germany, Spain or any other country.

This video debates some of the arguments given against Catalonia's viability as an independent nation, and it is based on an article from Xavier Sala-i-Martin, a Catalan-American professor of economics at Columbia University.
