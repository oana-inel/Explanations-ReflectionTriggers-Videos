Almost two million people according to local police gathered in Barcelona on Thursday to celebrate the Catalonian national day and to demand a referendum for the independence of Catalonia. 

Demonstrators marched through Diagonal Street and Gran Via, converging to form the letter ""V"" for ""vote"" and ""victory"". Protesters also waved pro-independence flags and shouted ""we want to vote"" and ""independence"". 

Many personalities addressed the crowds from three different stages along the march. Demonstrators explained that they did not feel Spanish and merely viewed Spain as a neighbour but not as part of their national and cultural identity.
