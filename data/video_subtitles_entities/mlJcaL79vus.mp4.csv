Hundreds gathered in downtown Barcelona to watch a public viewing on the big screen as 12 Catalonian independence leaders gave their testimonies, on the final day of their four-month trial.

Audiences cheered and applauded as the independence leaders voiced their final statements, arguing that the 2017 failed push for Catalan independence was a political, rather than criminal issue, and should be treated as such. Scores of banners reading ""We will do it again"" could be seen among the crowd.

Nine of the defendants, including former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras, face charges of rebellion, which carry sentences of 25 years. Others were charged with sedition and the misuse of public funds. Judges are expected to reach a decision on the case in several months.
