STORYLINE:

President George W. Bush signed a free trade agreement with six Latin American countries on Tuesday, celebrating a victory in Congress so narrow and grueling that it cast doubt on the future of other trade-opening pacts the administration is negotiating.

Bush's signature at a ceremony in the East Room of the White House put the final touch on the Central American Free Trade Agreement.

The measure was approved by Congress last week with just a two-vote margin in the House after a bruising battle over the future of US trade policy.

That 217-215 vote handed the president an important political victory after months of intense lobbying by the president and his trade officials.

Speaking at the signing ceremony, Bush said ""CAFTA is more than a trade bill.""   

He said the measure would help strengthen fragile young democracies in Latin America and show those countries that the United States would stand by their side.

The agreement, with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, removes trade barriers and opens up the region to US goods and services. 

It also takes steps to facilitate investment in the area and strengthens protections for intellectual property.

The measure drew heavy Democratic opposition as well as some Republican defections. 

Critics argued that it would send more US jobs overseas, although Bush argued the opposite.

Bush said it would open more markets in the region to American goods.

He has also cast the measure as an important component of his second-term vow to spread democracy and freedom throughout the world to combat terrorism.

Joining Bush at the ceremony were congressional sponsors of the pact and committee leaders and diplomats from the countries that are signatories.

STORYLINE:

President George W. Bush signed a free trade agreement with six Latin American countries on Tuesday, celebrating a victory in Congress so narrow and grueling that it cast doubt on the future of other trade-opening pacts the administration is negotiating.

Bush's signature at a ceremony in the East Room of the White House put the final touch on the Central American Free Trade Agreement.

The measure was approved by Congress last week with just a two-vote margin in the House after a bruising battle over the future of US trade policy.

That 217-215 vote handed the president an important political victory after months of intense lobbying by the president and his trade officials.

Speaking at the signing ceremony, Bush said ""CAFTA is more than a trade bill.""   

He said the measure would help strengthen fragile young democracies in Latin America and show those countries that the United States would stand by their side.

The agreement, with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, removes trade barriers and opens up the region to US goods and services. 

It also takes steps to facilitate investment in the area and strengthens protections for intellectual property.

The measure drew heavy Democratic opposition as well as some Republican defections. 

Critics argued that it would send more US jobs overseas, although Bush argued the opposite.

Bush said it would open more markets in the region to American goods.

He has also cast the measure as an important component of his second-term vow to spread democracy and freedom throughout the world to combat terrorism.

Joining Bush at the ceremony were congressional sponsors of the pact and committee leaders and diplomats from the countries that are signatories.
