He has devoted the past 30 years to educating parents and health practitioners about vaccines, encouraging informed consent and non-mandatory laws. He is the author of several articles, studies, and books on vaccines, including Miller’s Review of Critical Vaccine Studies(www.vacbook.com), Vaccine Safety Manual for Concerned Families and Health Practitioners(updated 2nd edition), and Vaccines, Are They Really Safe and Effective? Past organizations that he has lectured for include the International Chiropractic Pediatric Association, the International College of Integrative Medicine, the Hahnemann Academy of North America, and the Culture of Life Institute. Mr. Miller has a degree in psychology and is a member of Mensa.

 

Mr. Miller began his crusade against mandatory vaccines when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Very little data could be found on this topic. His search for the truth led him to scientific journals where numerous studies warned that vaccines are often unsafe and ineffective. His shock and anger at the suppression of this information culminated in his passionate defense of parents seeking to make truly informed vaccine decisions while retaining the right to accept or reject them.
