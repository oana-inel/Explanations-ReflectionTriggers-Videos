VVYBw3N1hy0,0,Me and my friends we walk around. We just can't go through that street. That's weird because there's a big protest I've seen like loads of like people with their hands up and just saying that they wanted to have democrasy and then policeman like hurting people. It wasn't normal because policemen are supposed to be defending units like hurting you people will step out onto their balconies with pots and pans and just start banging them as a peaceful protest. They always taught us in school don't use violin you have to talk about your problems and it says if they were like they didn't learn that the Spanish government and the catalonian government should already had talked about this and solved it. I'm so like frightened of time talking about possibilities of what could happen that I would rather like stay home and not know about what's going on.
