It's only various economic changes that have even flattened at all. So we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication. So you've got a thing on the left CO2 that you want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people the services each person's using on average the energy on average for each service and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
