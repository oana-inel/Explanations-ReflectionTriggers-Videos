And for that reason women will have fewer children because they need to have fewer in order to have more survive. Does that make sense? But the problem is that the disease is not only from lack of vaccines the diseases from undernutrition starvation lack of Clean Water lack of breastfeeding. So these are factors that could really be addressed without you know, benefiting the Pharma industry personally. Yeah, I think that vaccines can impair fertility.
