Y6E5Euli2Fc,0,We'll remember Edward Jenner who infected people with cowpox. He's credited with saving over 530 million lives with his smallpox vaccine. The secret behind vaccinology is basic trickery vaccines contain a weakened bacterium or virus that mimics natural infection triggering an immune response from the body the immune system rapidly built an army of cells designed to attack that specific infection destroying the weakened Invaders before they cause damage a number of specialized immune system cells remain called memory cells that can quickly detect and Destroy any later encounters with the disease. It's like target practice for your immune system and with many vaccines this immunity lasts for life. It were as long as vaccines have been fighting disease.
