E8rk9hYwYgk,0," In Take Over Control of the administration and the Parliament and the president of Catalonia will lose his position. In fact, it's even rumored that he could be arrested for treason. Now if this is the way Spain behaves it's very difficult to call it a modern-day democracy. They're behaving in a totalitarian way. This is like almost the old days of fascism under Franco. So I think what's going to happen is you're going to see possibly violence on the streets this time next week and I feel that the campaign now for Catalan separation can only grow Nigel Gerri Willis here.
