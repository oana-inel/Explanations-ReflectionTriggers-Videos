That's why the Obama Administration finally slapped the two hundred and sixty-six percent import Duty on state-subsidized Chinese steel that the public People's Republic was dumping in this country so that our steel makers could at least have a fighting chance to say a lot. I think we need to do a lot more than that, but I'm just some talking head on TV. So let's talk to someone who's a real expert here Dan D'Amico's the former CEO and chairman emeritus of Nucor the best steel maker in America while D'Amico is running a new court from 2003 to 2012. He gave you a monster seven hundred and twenty percent return. This is a hard-headed businessman who understands international trade, and he has been one of the few Executives to speak out against foolish free-trade policies, but countries that never intend to play by the rules to begin with.
