That is why school programs aim to vaccinate girls in grades five or six or seven or eight and because the peak risk for HPV is in the first five to ten years or sexual experience the window for receiving the vaccine continues to be open even after sexual activity begins. Now, I've been focusing on the experience of females, but there is an emerging research on whether male should receive the vaccine males are a major source of female affections and vice versa. So vaccinating young males would not only protect them against HPV, but also prevent much of the infection and females males who have sex with males are at higher risk.",0.8963966369628906,172.4,172.5,The,5
