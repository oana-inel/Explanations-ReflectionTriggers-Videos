qq9UtvtFpPA,0,Malaria is one of those diseases that's been around for so long that you would think we'd have figured out how to deal with it by now and yet it still kills almost half a million people every year and most of those people are kids one of the main reasons. It's still so deadly is that scientists have struggled to create an effective vaccine for it. But last week the World Health Organization announced that a malaria vaccine has finally made it over all the regulatory hurdles and is now being given out in the African country of Malawi and it'll be rolled out in Kenya and Ghana as well later this year for this pilot program. The vaccine will be available to children under the age of two and we'll hopefully reach around 360 thousand kids a year across these three countries and although this isn't going to eradicate the disease overnight if all goes well this vaccine could become one of the most important weapons in the war against malaria one that might actually give us a fighting chance.

The vaccine will be available to children under the age of two and we'll hopefully reach around 360 thousand kids a year across these three countries and although this isn't going to eradicate the disease overnight if all goes well this vaccine could become one of the most important weapons in the war against malaria one that might actually give us a fighting chance.

It's still so deadly is that scientists have struggled to create an effective vaccine for it. But last week the World Health Organization announced that a malaria vaccine has finally made it over all the regulatory hurdles and is now being given out in the African country of Malawi and it'll be rolled out in Kenya and Ghana as well later this year for this pilot program. The vaccine will be available to children under the age of two and we'll hopefully reach around 360 thousand kids a year across these three countries and although this isn't going to eradicate the disease overnight if all goes well this vaccine could become one of the most important weapons in the war against malaria one that might actually give us a fighting chance.

qq9UtvtFpPA,0,I've seen good enough to be implemented before this one known as rtss has been in the works for 30 years. It's simply taken that long to develop the vaccine get it working in animal models test it for safety and Effectiveness and people and then to make the big decision to start piloting it and here's the thing this vaccine isn't that amazing either and clinical trials. It was only about 40 percent effective which is way way less than say the MMR vaccine for measles which works in 93 percent of cases after just one dose and 97 percent after to the low Effectiveness was a disappointment to many scientists when it was first published and it's not the only drawback to this particular vaccine to get that 40 percent protection kids have to have three doses plus a booster. That's a lot of shots which means it's harder to ensure kids get through the whole vaccination process. Also it works best in kids 5 to 17 months old for younger infants.

It was only about 40 percent effective which is way way less than say the MMR vaccine for measles which works in 93 percent of cases after just one dose and 97 percent after to the low Effectiveness was a disappointment to many scientists when it was first published and it's not the only drawback to this particular vaccine to get that 40 percent protection kids have to have three doses plus a booster. That's a lot of shots which means it's harder to ensure kids get through the whole vaccination process. Also it works best in kids 5 to 17 months old for younger infants.
