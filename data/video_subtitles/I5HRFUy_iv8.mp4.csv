So most free trade deals simply Force other countries to lower their barriers down to where ours already are but most people still think that the u.s. Gains jobs when we sell our Goods to other countries and that we lose jobs when we buy goods from other countries, especially if those other countries have lower wages than we do the Assumption there making is that there is a fixed amount of work to be done and all we can do is fight over who gets to do it.
