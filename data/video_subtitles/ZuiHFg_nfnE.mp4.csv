ZuiHFg_nfnE,0," That's how you get an outbreak that's bad. But if lots of people are immunized then even if someone gets sick the likelihood of anyone else getting sick and spreading the disease is really low. That's good. And if there can't be an outbreak then everyone is protected even those who can't get vaccinated this is critical because there are people who are at increased risk for communicable diseases, but they can't be given shots for various reasons small babies for instance or susceptible to certain diseases, but they can't be given all vaccines.
