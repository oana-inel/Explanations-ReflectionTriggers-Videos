bjzThpQsEpI,0,"Hi, my name is Paul offit. I'm talking to you today from the vaccine education center here at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. I think one of the concerns parents have is about a potential additive to vaccines. The preservative Mercury can is mercury in vaccines and the answer that question is that that mercury is in some multi-dose preparations of the influenza vaccine. The form of mercury is called ethyl Mercury and the name of that product is called thimerosal. Now one could reasonably could be concerned about this knowing that mercury certainly at high concentrations can be toxic to the brain and it's so called the central nervous system. But but in order to understand, I think why it is that the Mercury that was contained or is contained in some multi-dose preparations. The flu vaccine isn't harmful. I think we need to step back and try and understand Mercury in our environment Mercury's in the Earth's crust. It has been ever since the formation of the earth.
