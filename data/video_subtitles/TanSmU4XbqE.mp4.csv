TanSmU4XbqE,0,"Today I'm talking all about the side effects of vaccination. So let's jump into the first question and that was sent in by an owner who's dog had got his vaccinations a day previously and he was shaking. He wasn't very well and wondering kind of is that normal? Is that something that can be expected? Well, let's start off with thinking what vaccines actually do so they're essentially a way of tricking the body into thinking that it is suffering from an infection so that it can then eliminate a true infection at the very early stages when it's just starting before it can then start to affect the rest of the body and a vaccine. Does this by the administration of either a dead virus or bacteria or a live version that has actually been modified so that it can't fully replicate replicate or only or it can't cause the full-blown disease that an unmodified bacteria or virus would do. So as a result will often actually see mild side effects, which are just signs that the body is essentially fighting a mild infection.",0.8645433783531189,0.2,0.5,Today,1

He wasn't very well and wondering kind of is that normal? Is that something that can be expected? Well, let's start off with thinking what vaccines actually do so they're essentially a way of tricking the body into thinking that it is suffering from an infection so that it can then eliminate a true infection at the very early stages when it's just starting before it can then start to affect the rest of the body and a vaccine. Does this by the administration of either a dead virus or bacteria or a live version that has actually been modified so that it can't fully replicate replicate or only or it can't cause the full-blown disease that an unmodified bacteria or virus would do. So as a result will often actually see mild side effects, which are just signs that the body is essentially fighting a mild infection.",0.8645433783531189,56.8,57.0,is,1
