This video is going to cover everything that you absolutely hate studying for your step 1 exam that includes the vaccine schedule as well as the developmental Milestones. So let's get right into this bear of a topic. The first thing we're going to talk about is the vaccine schedule and the most high yield thing to know in the vaccine schedule is what vaccines you give it to four and six months. Now the reason that this is how yield is because all of the other things pertaining to the vaccine schedule are really intuitive. So let's just review them rapidly just to make sure we're on the same page here. The first thing that you do when the baby's born is give them Hep B. This is a fact that most medical students know and therefore it's not tested very often. Another thing is that anyone who's 12 years old or older they get all the pre-college shit, right? You gotta give them their meningitis and their yearly flu vaccine because they're soon going to be transitioning into a phase of their life.",0.8865219354629517,59.4,59.6,their,1

So let's start with the six-month category. So six months six is going to be all of your asses. So it's six months the baby's going to be able to sit up. It's going to be able to switch objects between its hands or transfer objects between the Sands. It's going to be able to schmooze right? It's just gonna be able to babble on and on and on like my grandmother. It's just going to be able to babble and then for social it's going to have stranger anxiety. So all of these things begin with the letter s which is going to be S 46 has again the baby can sit up it can switch objects between its hands it can schmooze or just Babble and it has stranger anxiety. That's your sixes. The next thing we're going to do is hit the twelves twelves obviously going to be art he's 12 you're going to be on two legs, right? It can walk on two legs.
