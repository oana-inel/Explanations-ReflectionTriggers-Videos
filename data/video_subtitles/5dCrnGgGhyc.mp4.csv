5dCrnGgGhyc,0,"In this video we're going to talk about how a country can gain from importing Goods through International Trade. So let's take the market for steel in the United States. Let's assume that the market before there's any international trade or anything. Let's assume that the equilibrium price of steel and the United States is five hundred and sixty two dollars a ton. So we've got our price here. We've got our downward sloping demand curve. We've got an upward sloping supply curve and this is the supply of Steel in the US and the demand for steel in the u.s. So that leads to an equilibrium right here and we've got equilibrium price of 562 a ton and then an equilibrium quantity of 10 million tons of steel right here.
