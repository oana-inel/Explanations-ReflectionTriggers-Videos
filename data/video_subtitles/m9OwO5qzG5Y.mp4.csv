I would much rather have a lot of small Enterprises but there's all the difference in the world between a private conglomerate and a government conglomerate in general. The government conglomerate can get money from you without your agreed to give it to him you and I pay for Amtrak and for the postal deficit whether we use the services of Amtrak or the postal deficit or not. I don't pay your conglomerate unless I rent one of their apartment I get something for my money, so",0.9128405451774596,286.5,286.9,"money,",5
