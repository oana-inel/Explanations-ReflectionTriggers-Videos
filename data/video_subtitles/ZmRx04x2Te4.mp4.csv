ZmRx04x2Te4,0, New arthritis pill helps stop bone damage scientists have found a new drug that can potentially stop bone loss and damage in people with disease joints. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease caused by the breakdown of protected bone cartilage often in the knees hands hips and spine. The condition has no known cure but a new drug called m1v 711 has been shown to help reduce bone damage in affected joints. The treatment is based on a molecule involved in bone and cartilage turnovers and works by interfering with a process that leads to Joint breakdown when tested in patients aged 40 to 80 the drug reduced bone loss in the knees by 65% and improved cartilage thickness in just six months by contrast those given a placebo reported a slight increase in bone loss.,0.9046472907066344,502.0,503.9,New,15

The condition has no known cure but a new drug called m1v 711 has been shown to help reduce bone damage in affected joints. The treatment is based on a molecule involved in bone and cartilage turnovers and works by interfering with a process that leads to Joint breakdown when tested in patients aged 40 to 80 the drug reduced bone loss in the knees by 65% and improved cartilage thickness in just six months by contrast those given a placebo reported a slight increase in bone loss.,0.9046472907066344,504.3,504.6,pill,15

The condition has no known cure but a new drug called m1v 711 has been shown to help reduce bone damage in affected joints. The treatment is based on a molecule involved in bone and cartilage turnovers and works by interfering with a process that leads to Joint breakdown when tested in patients aged 40 to 80 the drug reduced bone loss in the knees by 65% and improved cartilage thickness in just six months by contrast those given a placebo reported a slight increase in bone loss.,0.9046472907066344,543.3,543.8,thickness,15
