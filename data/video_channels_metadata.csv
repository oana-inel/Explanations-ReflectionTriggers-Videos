Catalonia continues calls for independence 
01 March, 2010, 08:29
Catalonias unofficial polls have shown the Spanish region is strongly in favor of separation. But as calls for a referendum on independence continue, the issue seems far more complicated. 
Catalonias political struggle for independence is centuries-old. The prosperous province of seven million people already has enough national symbols, its own language, world-renowned architecture and an iconic football team, worshipped by fans worldwide.
Spain ignores our right to self-determination, explains a local Catalan. They restrict our language and culture, at least at an official level.
But the question Catalonia is facing is whether or not its quest for independence is more than just a game and it is indeed capable of becoming a viable state.
Local nationalists have staged several unofficial independence polls across some parts of Catalonia.
Each one has resulted in an overwhelming yes vote, though with small turn-outs. But the national government in Madrid has dismissed the results.
If people vote for independence, we will get independence, says Alfons Lopez Tena, a referendum organizer. We are fighting peacefully for democracy to make sure that the people's will can overcome the obstacles of the Spanish government.
Spanish laws passed four years ago already give Catalonia's local parliament the power to raise taxes, along with other responsibilities. Opponents of the law are challenging it in Spain's Supreme Court, saying it goes too far.
But some Catalonians take a radically different view.
We contribute billions of Euros to the government in Spain, we want to manage our own economy, says a Catalan resident. And without them we'd manage it better.
However, while it is the separatists who seem to speak loudest, the Catalan desire for full independence is not clear-cut. Official surveys suggest that in fact no more than one in five Catalans support it.
The economic justification for splitting from Spain is also being questioned.
Whenever people speak about Catalonia they mention its economic wealth. But the economic and social cost of setting up independent institutions would be formidable. For example, Catalonia doesn't have its own judicial system or army, says Montserrat Nebrera, Professor of Constitutional Law and Politicians
Independence for any Spanish region is not possible without major changes to the country's constitution, and Madrid remains staunchly opposed to separatism. Thus, it appears that despite vehement calls, any redrawing of maps may take a long time to achieve.

Momentum is growing in the Spanish region of Catalonia for an official referendum on independence. Catalonians say they should become another EU state as they have their own language and national symbols. So far unofficial polls have been overwhelmingly in favour of separation, which the Spanish government has dismissed as RT's Igor Ogorodnev reports.",2d,7.0,PT3M21S,['http://rt.com/Top_News/2010-03-01/catalonia-independence-spain-referendum.html'],vA-3tvlYy1s,21.0,rectangular,"['RT', 'separatism', 'Spain', 'Barcelona', 'Spanish', 'constitution', 'referendum', 'Igor', 'Ogorodnev']",Catalan calls for independence from Spain - RT 100301,4843,"['Channel not found.', 'RT', 'RT America', 'Link TV', 'The White House', 'U.S. Department of State', 'C-SPAN']"

For decades, the world has been dominated by a process known as globalization, a secularizing economic and political system that hollows out and erodes a culture’s traditions, customs, and religions, all the while conditioning populations to rely on the expertise of a tiny class of technocrats for every aspect of their social and economic lives.

Until now.

All over the world, there’s been a massive blowback against the anti-cultural processes of globalization and its secular aristocracy. 

And it’s just the beginning.

I believe that the secular world is at its brink, and a new conservative age is rising.

Summary:
--------------
Catalonia is a nation within Spain with its own language and culture. For many years, Catalonia has been submitted to several oppressive laws that looked for Spain's homogeneity by settling a single language and centralizing power, and trying to extinct any other identity different from the Spanish one. In 1978, after fascist Franco's dictatorship, Catalonia gained a certain level of auto-government but today Spain is limiting our capacity to further administrate our justice, economy and language issues.
 
Independentism in Catalonia has been growing during the last 30 years, and many Spaniards think that Catalonia's independence is a silly thing. They argue that Catalan nationalism is a bad thing, but they never talk about Spanish nationalism, which, for them, is the only one that is good. Furthermore, being independentist does not necessarily mean being nationalist! I like being independent from other people, but that does not mean I am better than them!

Catalan independentism does not mean hating Spain: it simply looks for a better status for Catalonia, which is as legitimate as for France, Germany, Spain or any other country.

This video debates some of the arguments given against Catalonia's viability as an independent nation, and it is based on an article from Xavier Sala-i-Martin, a Catalan-American professor of economics at Columbia University.

The heavy-handedness, the Francoist elements of the behaviour by Madrid, is pushing Catalonia out of Spain.""

The Louisiana team produces videos about art and culture on an ongoing basis, and new videos are posted every week.

Louisiana Channel contributes to the permanent development of the museum as a cultural platform and wants to enhance the sense of the importance of art and culture.

Something similar wouldn’t be allowed in other democratic European countries, Marías argues: “They have a constitution prohibiting parties openly wanting to divide the country or wanting to separate from the country.” This, he finds, is also proof that present-day Spain is a true democracy and doesn’t bear similarities to Franco’s regime, as the Catalan movement suggest: “They are the Spanish state in Catalonia. It’s ridiculous because they have rebelled against exactly what allows them to exist.” Moreover, though Marías – who is not “a great fan of my country” – understands the desire to separate from Spain, he doesn’t think that it should be with these people: “I wouldn’t like to be one of their subjects. Because they would be subjects, I’m sure of that. Not citizens, subjects.”

Javier Marías (b. 1951) is one of Spain’s most celebrated novelists, whose has been translated into numerous languages. He was born in Madrid, but – during the Franco regime – he spent parts of his childhood in the U.S., where his father taught at higher education institutions. Among his novels are ‘All Souls’ (1992) (Todas las almas, 1989), ‘A Heart So White’ (2012) (Corazón tan blanco, 1992), ‘The Infatuations’ (2013) (Los enamoramientos, 2011), ‘Berta Isla’ (2018) (Berta Isla, 2017) as well as the ‘Your Face Tomorrow’ trilogy (2004-2009) (Tu rostro manana, 2002-2007), which was hailed by the Guardian as “the first authentic literary masterpiece in the 21st century.” Marías is the recipient of prestigious awards such as the International Dublin Literary Award (1997) and the Prix Formentor (2013). Marías is also a columnist for El País as well as a respected translator of e.g. Shakespeare, Henry James, and Nabokov. Moreover, he operates the small publishing house Reino de Redonda. 

Javier Marías was interviewed by Synne Rifbjerg at the Louisiana Literature festival at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark in August 2018.

তবে স্পেনের সাংবিধানিক আদালত এ গণভোটকে অবৈধ বলে ঘোষণা দেয়। দেশটির পুলিশ গণভোট আয়োজনে বাধা প্রদান করলে সংঘর্ষে হাজার হাজার লোক আহত হয়। এমনকি ভোট গ্রহন বন্ধ করে দিতে পুলিশ অনেক ভোট কেন্দ্রের ব্যালট বাক্স ও ব্যালট পেপার জব্দ করে।
কাতালান নেতা পুজডেমন্ড গণভোটের ফলাফল কিছুদিনের মধ্যে কাতালান সংসদে পাঠাবেন বলে জানান। অন্যদিকে ‘স্বাধীনতা ও অধিকারে হস্তক্ষেপ করার’ প্রতিবাদে কাতালানের ৪০টির বেশি ব্যবসায় জোট ও অ্যাসোসিয়েশন আগামী মঙ্গলবার এ অঞ্চল জুড়ে ধর্মঘটের ডাক দেয়।
এর আগে স্পেনের প্রধানমন্ত্রী মারিয়ানো রাজয় বলেন, কাতালানরা এই অবৈধ ভোটে অংশ নিয়ে বোকামি করেছে। তিনি এ ভোটকে গণতন্ত্রের ‘প্রহসন’ বলে আখ্যা দেন।

On October 1, 2017, Catalonia voted for independence, despite opposition from the central Spanish government.

The northeast region of Catalonia is one of Spain's 17 autonomous communities. It's home to 7.5 million people, and has its own distinct language, history, and culture, according to the bBC.

Catalonia was once under the kingdom of Aragon, which unified with Castile in the 15th century. It remained a state until it was defeated in the 1714 Siege of Barcelona, and its sovereignty was abolished. Under the newly centralized Spanish realm, Catalans were forced to adopt the Castilian language and customs.

The region regained autonomy when Spain became a republic in 1931, but lost it again during the Franco dictatorship. Franco's death restored democracy, allowing Catalonia to have its own Parliament, police force, and education system.

Though they have a high degree of autonomy, Catalans are not satisfied with the central government.

As Spain's wealthiest region, it generates 20% of the national GDP. But high budget cuts during the 2008 financial crisis, and complaints of paying more taxes than they get back have increased separatist sentiment.

The Brookings Institute reports that in 2010, the Spanish Constitutional Court reversed a 2006 ruling that granted the region 'nation' status and its own tax system, angering many and fueling the movement for independence.

This movement culminated in the October 1 referendum, which Madrid has called illegal.

A Catalonian secession would impact the Spanish economy, but also see the region out of the EU. With no free trade, the region's economy could shrink, and the unemployment rate could double.

But do all Catalans want independence? Polls taken before the referendum showed that while 70% wanted the right to vote, only 41% sought independence.

Still, Madrid's response was aggressive. It arrested Catalan leaders, and took down websites and apps in an effort to thwart the vote.

On the day of the referendum, violence erupted as police seized ballots, and forcibly stopped people from voting. Despite the danger, voter turnout was at 42.3%, with nearly 90% of those who voted backing secession.

Catalan's president has said he will declare independence within 48 hours if the 'yes' side won. If this happens, Spain will enter a constitutional crisis and may be forced to suspend Catalonia's autonomy.

""Catalonia declared itself an independent republic on Friday. But nobody is sure how long it will last.
Within hours of Catalonia’s emotional vote, Spain’s prime minister announced he would dismantle the Catalan government, suspend its ministers, dissolve its upstart parliament, take over the regional police and call home any Catalan diplomats abroad.
The orders were effective immediately. In a Europe where change once took place at a glacial pace, this was the latest surprise in a continent rocked by division and upset, populism and nationalism.
But how the central government will enforce its orders is the question everyone is asking. Will the National Police carry out the new orders? Or will the separatist leaders in Barcelona step aside to fight another day?”*

[2017/2847(RSP)]

Transcript:
Aside from the really important issue of Brexit, I think European citizens, those that do take any interest in what happens here, will be stunned that Mr Juncker comes here for his one appearance in the Strasbourg session this week and there is absolutely no mention made of the dramatic events that have taken place inside a European Union member state, that is allegedly a modern democracy.

One of the reasons that I always wanted Brexit was because I thought the system of law making whereby the Commission has the sole right to initiate legislation was something that would in fact damage, and in the end destroy, any concept of national democracy. And yeah, I’ve called the European Union undemocratic, I’ve called it antidemocratic, but never, ever in my fiercest criticisms here did I think we would see the police of a member state of the union injuring 900 people in an attempt to stop them going out to vote.

Whether or not it was legal nationally for people in Catalonia to have a vote, surely people are allowed to express an opinion. We saw women being dragged out of polling stations by their hair, old ladies with gashes in their forehead. The most extraordinary display and what do we get from Mr Juncker today? Not a dickie-bird.

In fact previously we had that the rule of law must be maintained and I think it is quite extraordinary to realise that this union is prepared to turn a blind eye. Can you imagine the British police would have roughed up a couple of Scottish National Party protestors or if something happened against a pro-Remain rally you’d all be screaming blue murder, indeed the calls would be that the United Kingdom must go before the European Court of Human Rights and yet with this you don’t even want to talk about it. Knowing as I do, your advance plans, seven of you members states here with your military police, your euro gendarmerie force, all I can say once again is thank god we’re leaving.

Brexit was an act of liberation, it was a voice of national self-determination that cannot and will not be stopped, but through this negotiating process I’m afraid from the start you’ve treated us as if we’re some kind of hostage. Unless we pay a ransom, unless we meet all of your demands, all of your demands, then you won’t even have an intelligent conversation with us about trade heading on from here.

There are no guarantees that whatever Mrs May says or does that you will ever, even when we’ve met your demands, that you will ever come to us and want to have a sensible trade agreement. And I have to say, that it is sad, in fact it was pitiful, to see the British Prime Minister in Florence. I heard you say that you thought she was being conciliatory, that she’s been grown up, people are happy with what she’s said. Actually Mrs May I’m sad to say isn’t worldly enough to recognise that when you face up to a bully the one thing that you do not do is try to appease them. She’s begging you to give her a transition period and there’s no guarantee that you will do it.

So I do actually agree with the criticisms that I’ve heard around the room about the mixed messages coming out from the UK government. I just hope that in Manchester the Conservative Party start to say in public what they’re all saying to me in private, that she’s a waste of space, she needs to go, that we need a proper Prime Minister who says to Monsieur Barnier ‘okay, here’s a deadline. Here’s a date, we work towards that date and if we can’t reach a sensible deal on trade and everything else then we are simply leaving and reverting to WTO rules.’ This charade cannot go on for year after year, after all we voted for Brexit.

More than 800 people were injured after Spanish police stormed polling stations and tried to forcibly prevent people from voting, firing tear gas and physically attacking prospective voters. Late on Sunday night, the Catalan regional government said 90 percent of Catalan voters chose independence. The Catalan government now says it plans to unilaterally declare independence from Spain within 48 hours. Spain says it will recognize neither the results of the referendum nor a declaration of independence. The escalating conflict is being described as the biggest constitutional crisis in Spain since the end of the Franco dictatorship in the 1970s. For more, we speak with Sebastiaan Faber, professor of Hispanic studies at Oberlin College and author of the forthcoming book ""Memory Battles of the Spanish Civil War: History, Fiction, Photography.""

The protesters armed with colored powder and the Policemen with shields and batons. many reported ""I saw a policeman brutally beating a protester"" 

Thousands of pro-independence took to the streets of Barcelona today 29.09.2018 to oppose a march by Spanish police unions that wanted to honor officers that took part in last year's referendum crackdown.

The Mossos d'Esquadra, tryed to avoid the opposing groups from coming face-to-face. Around Via Laietana, right in the city center of the Catalan capital, as the Mossos tried to keep the pro-independence groups away from the Spanish agents. Police brutality is clear.

The Catalan independence referendum of 2017, also known by the numeronym 1-O (for ""1 October"") in Spanish media, was an independence referendum held on 1 October 2017 in the Spanish autonomous community of Catalonia, passed by the Parliament of Catalonia as the Law on the Referendum on Self-determination of Catalonia and called by the Generalitat de Catalunya. It was declared illegal on 7 September 2017 and suspended by the Constitutional Court of Spain after a request from the Spanish government, who declared it a breach of the Spanish Constitution.  Additionally, in early September the High Court of Justice of Catalonia had issued orders to the police to try to prevent it, including the detention of various persons responsible for its preparation. Due to alleged irregularities during the voting process as well as to the use of force by the National Police and Civil Guard, international observers invited by the Generalitat declared that the referendum failed to meet the minimum international standards for elections.

El referèndum sobre la independència de Catalunya (oficialment Referèndum d'Autodeterminació de Catalunya, conegut pel numerònim 1-O) és un referèndum d'autodeterminació vinculant que fou celebrat l'1 d'octubre de 2017.

Fou organitzat pel Govern de Catalunya, format després d'unes eleccions en les quals els partidaris del referèndum van obtenir la majoria en el Parlament de Catalunya. Tanmateix, el Govern d'Espanya s'hi oposà, d'acord amb la interpretació de les lleis i la Constitució del país en aquell moment. La seva convocatòria va ser oficialment suspesa pel Tribunal Constitucional d'Espanya l'endemà de l'aprovació, però el Govern català continuà la seva organització, basant-se en la Llei del referèndum d'autodeterminació de Catalunya, aprovada el 6 de setembre de 2017, el referèndum es convocà enmig d'un xoc de legalitats vigents. Més de dos milions de persones van votar i es van produir escenes de forta violència física per part dels cossos i forces de seguretat de l'Estat.

The vote brought to a head a weeks-long standoff with Madrid that began with a disputed referendum on October 1, and came as the Spanish Senate approved the Madrid government's unprecedented plans to seize control of the autonomous region.
The Spanish government is now expected to begin moves at the weekend to remove from office the Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and his ministers, and impose direct rule from Madrid. Lawmakers voted in secret in the Catalan Parliament chamber after a heated debate on a motion ""to form the Catalan Republic as an independent and sovereign state.""
The outcome: 70 votes in favor, 10 against and two blanks. Opposition lawmakers walked out of the chamber ahead of the vote. Pro-independence crowds massed outside the Parliament cheered and waved the Catalan ""Estelada"" separatist flag as the result was announced. Within minutes, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy tweeted an appeal for calm. ""I ask all Spaniards to remain calm. The rule of law will restore legality in Catalonia,"" he said.
The two parliamentary sessions were the culmination of a weeks-long standoff, which began on October 1 when Catalonia defied Madrid and held a banned referendum on independence, plunging Spain into its worst political crisis since the restoration of democracy in the 1970s. Hopes for a resolution were dashed Thursday when Puigdemont backed away from a plan to call new elections himself, amid disagreement within his own party and pressure from opposing sides. Hopes for a resolution were dashed Thursday when Puigdemont backed away from a plan to call new elections himself, amid disagreement within his own party and pressure from opposing sides.
 Speaking in the Catalan Parliament building after the landmark vote, Puigdemont said legitimately elected lawmakers had cast their ballots according to a mandate earned in the October 1 referendum.
But he acknowledged that the path ahead would not be easy. ""We are facing a period in which we will need to stay strong and in peace, dignified and civil as we have always been, and I'm sure we will keep being so,"" he said.
""The institutions and the people together built nations, societies, and a nation cannot be built without one of these elements.""
Supporters followed his words with applause and repeated chants of ""freedom, freedom."" Source: CNN

At the heart of Gates' address lies the central Global Warming dogma, which dictates that Co2 emitted by human beings are the primary culprit for the unwanted heating of the globe. Since this artificial alleged human-induced heating effect allegedly stands to devastate the planet if left unabated, Global Warming dogma proponents therefore argue that human Co2 emissions must be drastically reduced. As Gates casually addresses the issue, he goes on to state that one way to accomplish this goal is to reduce the global human population. 

ERRATUM: To be completely fair and accurate, I should have stated that Gates seeks to reduce the anticipated growth of the human population rather than that he seeks to reduce the current population. I admit that the latter slogan, that is contained in the video, is a bit misleading and I do not want to insinuate that Gates seeks to kill off currently living people. He rather seeks to lower the projected population growth.

He postulates the central equation, giving an estimation of the humanly emitted C02 load per year, to be:

Co2 = P times S times E times C

Where P stands for the population number, S the average number of services per person, E the average amount of energy units per service, and C the average Co2 emitted load per unit of service, per year; Co2 stands for the projected total humanly emitted carbon-dioxide load by the entire population per year.

In the first clip you will hear him state in plain language that he considers VACCINES to be desirable to bring down the future population number P and so reduce Co2. You will also casually hear him promoting HEALTH CARE and REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES, to accomplish that same C02 reducing goal.

Here are Bill Gates' verbatim words [square parentheses additions for clarification purposes are mine though]:
""The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's heading up to about nine billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that [number of 9 billion] by perhaps 10 or 15 percent. But there we see an increase of about 1.3 [billion].""

Let's focus on the vaccines. Gates is stating that  he considers vaccines to be useful in contributing to bring the projected population growth of 2.2 billion down to 1.3 billion, roughly one billion. What kind of properties can thus reasonably be deduced that vaccines are to have according to Gates? Well, basically all the properties that impede people to either have children, or successfully rear them. In other words, Gates implicitly advocates the definition of his favorite kind of vaccine to be one that fosters infertility, sterility and (early onset) senility (autism) alike. Note that Gates does not mention a word on the much touted purported intention of vaccines: to offer protection against relevant diseases and therefore as such, precisely prolong life. Given the abundance of toxins in vaccines (see my blog for some links of simply Google ""toxin ingredient vaccine""), the position that vaccines contribute to decrease mortality rates, is kind of hard to maintain.

So Gates proves to be quite the humanitarian there huh? 

In the second excerpt you hear Gates explain what he considers to be the single most important thing that he would choose to see become a reality in the future time span of 50 years. He again confirms his ""love"" for the vaccine.

As more and more parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children or are vaccinating them later, diseases like measles are making a comeback. What's behind this antivax movement? Are vaccines safe? How do vaccines work? Why do some people claim there is a link between vaccines and autism?

The moment arrived -- symbolic for the 11 September 1714, Catalonia Day, when Barcelona fell in the War of Succession - and the spectators began chanting 'In, inde, independència' and waved thousands of 'Senyeras' and 'Esteladas' (Catalan independence flags) as called for by various quarters over recent days, among them the Catalan National Assembly (ANC).

Prior to the match, the fans were already singing for independence and the 'Blaugrana' stadium was decorated with a giant mosaic featuring the 'Senyera' and the word 'Barça' made up of 98,000 coloured cards that was displayed when the players took to the pitch and while Barça's anthem was played over the loudspeaker. A banner could also be seen featuring the slogan 'Catalonia next European state'.

La gran mayoría de los aficionados han clamado a favor de la independencia de Cataluña en el minuto 17 con 14 segundos de la primera parte, en un partido con diversas acciones con significación política.

Llegado este minuto -simbólico por su coincidencia con el 11 de septiembre de 1714, Diada de Cataluña, cuando Barcelona cayó derrotada en la Guerra de Sucesión-, el público se ha arrancado con gritos de 'In, inde, independència' y ha ondeado miles de 'senyeras' y 'esteladas', como habían pedido determinadas plataformas los últimos días, entre ellas la Assemblea Nacional Catalana (ANC).

Antes del inicio del encuentro, la afición ya había cantado a favor de la independencia y el estadio blaugrana se ha engalanado con un mosaico gigante formado por 98.000 cartulinas con los colores de la 'senyera' y la palabra 'Barça!' como protagonistas, que ha lucido cuando los jugadores han saltado al campo y mientras sonaba el himno del Barça por megafonía.

Once the antigens enter the blood, they circulate along with other cells, such B and T cells. B and T cells are white blood cells that help the body defend itself against foreign invaders. As the antigens invade the body's tissues, they attract the attention of macrophages. Macrophages are non-specific scavengers, which in this case, engulf the antigens. The macrophages then signal the T cells that antigens are invading. The killer-type of T cells respond by attacking the invading antigen. Finally, the suppressor T cells stop the attack. After a vaccination, the body will have a memory of an encounter with a potentially dangerous invader for a period of time, and hopefully have a better ability to fight it off if ever exposed to it again in greater numbers. A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing micro-organism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and keep a record of it, so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these micro-organisms that it later encounters. Vaccines can be prophylactic (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or ""wild"" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g., vaccines against cancer are also being investigated). The administration of vaccines is called vaccination. The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified; for example, the influenza vaccine,  the HPV vaccine, and the chicken pox vaccine. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases;  widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that licensed vaccines are currently available to prevent or contribute to the prevention and control of twenty-five infections.

Vaccine Basics How Vaccines Work What is Immunity? When disease germs enter your body, they start to reproduce. Your immune system recognizes these germs as foreign invaders and responds by making proteins called antibodies. These antibodies’ first job is to help destroy the germs that are making you sick. They can’t act fast enough to prevent you from becoming sick, but by eliminating the attacking germs, antibodies help you to get well. The antibodies’ second job is to protect you from future infections. They remain in your bloodstream, and if the same germs ever try to infect you again — even after many years — they will come to your defense. Only now that they are experienced at fighting these particular germs, they can destroy them before they have a chance to make you sick. This is immunity. It is why most people get diseases like measles or chickenpox only once, even though they might be exposed many times during their lifetime. Vaccines to the Rescue. Vaccines offer a solution to this problem. They help you develop immunity without getting sick first.
Vaccines are made from the same germs (or parts of them) that cause disease; for example, polio vaccine is made from polio virus. But the germs in vaccines are either killed or weakened so they won’t make you sick. Vaccines containing these weakened or killed germs are introduced into your body, usually by injection. Your immune system reacts to the vaccine the same as it would if it were being invaded by the disease — by making antibodies. The antibodies destroy the vaccine germs just as they would the disease germs — like a training exercise. Then they stay in your body, giving you immunity. If you are ever exposed to the real disease, the antibodies are there to protect you.
Why are vaccinations important?
Vaccinations protect your child against serious diseases by stimulating the immune system to create antibodies against certain bacteria or viruses.
What diseases do vaccines protect against?
Immunizing your baby with vaccines protects against serious diseases like measles, whooping cough, polio, meningococcal disease, tetanus, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, chickenpox, influenza, and more.
I don’t know anybody who has had these diseases. Why does my baby need these vaccines?
While a few of these diseases have virtually disappeared because of vaccination, reported cases of people with diseases like measles and whooping cough have been on the increase lately. Even if some diseases do completely disappear in the U.S., they are common in other parts of the world and are just a plane ride away.",2d,85.0,PT1M27S,[],2FY9Yg85JHM,519.0,rectangular,"['vaccine', 'vaccination', 'injection', 'antigen', 'body', 'human body', 'B cell', 'T cell', 'white blood cells', 'wbc', 'blood', 'immunity', 'immunology', 'macrophage', 'animation', 'video', 'body defence system', 'How Do Vaccines Work', 'how they work', 'vaccines explained', 'immune system', 'disease', 'microbe', 'toxins', 'pathogen', 'infectious diseases', 'infections', 'how vaccines work', 'vaccine documentary', 'vaccine mechanism', 'vaccination explained', 'how does vaccination work', 'vaccines truth', 'understanding vaccines', 'microbiology', 'lecture', 'medical']",How Vaccines Work in the Human Body Animation - Immune System Response to Vaccination Video,182658,

Bill Gates recently went on record at a TED conference declaring that his foundation's vaccine programs' goals were to reduce the poulation. This has led a lot of people to jump to the conclusion that he was saying his vaccines affect fertility. However, if you look at previous interviews on teh subject, you will see that it's not tat simple and that there is a lot of twisted logic involved. Bottom line: Gates is an admitted depopulationist. Would you trust his intentions when it comes to people's health?

Be Sweet to Babies
Research shows - for infants less than 12 months of age:
1. Breastfeeding before, during and after the injection reduces pain in babies. For best effect, begin breastfeeding 2-5 minutes before the needle.
If your baby requires a further injection in the other leg, position your baby on the other breast. Ensure your baby has latched and is sucking well before the next needle is given.

2. If you are not breastfeeding, giving small amounts of sugar water before and during pokes reduces pain in babies. 

Remember -- Be Sweet to Babies during vaccinations
Ask your nurses or doctors about breastfeeding during vaccinations or other needles as well as other ways we can help babies during painful procedures.

Instead, the results show, parental concerns that steer young people away from vaccination tend to focus on safety worries, lack of necessity, knowledge about HPV and absence of physician recommendation, according to Johns Hopkins researchers who led the investigation.

Keep in mind that, as the note states in the video, a woman may be vaccinated against rubella as a child but find out when pregnant that she has a ""low titer"" of Rubella antibodies and therefore be vulnerable. As the note mentions, some vaccines require ""booster"" doses.

Health & Medicine on Khan Academy: No organ quite symbolizes love like the heart. One reason may be that your heart helps you live, by moving ~5 liters (1.3 gallons) of blood through almost 100,000 kilometers (62,000 miles) of blood vessels every single minute! It has to do this all day, everyday, without ever taking a vacation! Now that is true love. Learn about how the heart works, how blood flows through the heart, where the blood goes after it leaves the heart, and what your heart is doing when it makes the sound “Lub Dub.”

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy is a nonprofit with a mission to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. We believe learners of all ages should have unlimited access to free educational content they can master at their own pace.

With vaccines, we take advantage of one of the most important aspects of the immune system - the ability to develop immunological memory. This means, that once the person or animal is exposed to a particular pathogen, in other words anything that can cause an illness, they will develop resistance to infection with the same pathogen in the future.

By taking advantage of immunological memory, vaccination prevents and controls the spread of a wide range of illnesses, including polio, smallpox, whooping cough, measles and the seasonal influenza virus.

Hi friends............Welcome to abmbbs.......Today's topic is MEASLES....First up Measles is caused by Paramyxovirus which is a RNA virus.....

next, what is the incubation period of measles??it is 10 to 14days.......now if you consider this to be the timeline.....& this as the point of exposure on day 0....then.....fever occurs on day 10 & rash occurs on day 14.
But remember......the incubation period of vaccine induced measles is only 7 days...

next, the source of measles infection is from cases.... there is no carrier in measles...there is no animal reservoir too.....

the mode of transmission of measles is by air droplets

the period of communicability of measles is from 4 days before to 4 days after the appearance of rash...

the Secondary attack rate of measles is 80%

measles also shows seasonal trend every 2 to 3 yrs....and it mainly occurs in the period of january to april that is in early spring

the clinical features of measles is divided into 3 stages......the 1st stage which is the prodromal stage causes fever, coryza & nasal discharge...............in the eruptive stage dusky red coloured maculopapular rash occurs....like this.....mind you the rash begins from behind the ear....that is it has retro auricular origin.
….................................in this stage koplik spot also occurs.....like this....this one....& this one....it is a characteristic sign of measles......it occurs in the buccal mucosa opposite the 2nd molar............................finally there is the Post measles stage which is characterised by wt loss & diarrhoea.


Next, the complications of measles....otitis media is the most common complication.....& pneumonia is the most common life threatening complication....another late complication of measles is called SSPE which stands for sub acute sclerosing pan encephalitis....it is extremely rare & occurs in about 7 per million cases of measles.

Finally we come to the topic of measles vaccine....this one.........it is a live attenuated freeze dried lyophilised vaccine....i have explained the meaning of each of these words in my previous video on BCG vaccination....the link is available right here...

the measles vaccine is most commonly derived from the Edmonston zagreb strain

what is the dose?....the dose is 0.5ml given subcutaneously in the antero lateral aspect of thigh.

The diluent used is distilled water & not normal saline

the vaccine is to be stored at 2 to 8 degree celsius...

the measles vaccine is  remarkable since it not only gives a protective efficacy of 90% with just the 1st dose but also gives lifelong protection
bt it is susceptable to light & must be stored in dark vials

finally when is the measles vaccine given??......it is given exactly at 9 months age......why?.....bcz till 9 months the maternal antibodies protect the baby & any vaccination before that would be rendered ineffective by the natural antibodies acquired from the mother. 
But immunization later than 9 months means that many children will contract measles in the interval between the weaning off of the natural antibodies & the introduction of the vaccine.So the WHO expanded immunization program has recommended immunization at 9 months & india has adopted the same.

• Créer un pont entre la médecine conventionnelle et les autres pratiques. Construire un avenir où les médecines se parlent, non plus parallèles mais convergentes.
• Informer et sensibiliser le grand public afin qu’il devienne acteur de sa propre santé. Le former et lui apprendre à se prendre en charge par rapport à son bien-être.
• Envisager sa santé non plus par rapport à la maladie mais par rapport à la prévention. Et donner la parole au public afin de lui apporter des réponses concrètes.
• Réconcilier le corps et l’esprit, trop souvent dissociés dans les approches modernes de la médecine.
• Inscrire le projet dans un cadre d’utilité publique et apporter un changement de grille de lecture de la santé dans le paysage audiovisuel.

Son livre: http://amzn.to/2uGO4H1.

Il explique qu'un vaccin est destiné à stimuler une première réponse du système immunitaire avec un pathogène (virus, bactérie) inactivé ou diminué afin que celui-ci soit en mesure de se protéger une fois que l'individu rentrera en contact avec la maladie.

Les 3 vaccins obligatoires sont ceux de la Dyphtérie, de la Polio et du Tétanos. Mais le vaccin DTP (ou DT-Polio) réunissant les 3 vaccins n'est plus fabriqué par les laboratoires sous prétexte qu'il provoquait des allergies. On a ainsi ajouté la Coqueluche puis l'Haemophilus (méningites) et enfin l'Hépatite B aux 3 vaccins obligatoires pour en faire un vaccin hexavalent (vaccin à 6 valences). C'est pour Michel Georget une manipulation financière car les vaccins hexavalents sont jusqu'à 7 fois plus chers. De plus, refaire un vaccin tétravalent moins cher ne serait pas rentable pour l'industrie pharmaceutique.

Pour Michel Georget, cela amène la question du calendrier vaccinal et la charge de vaccins bien trop importante pour le corps des enfants, encore en développement. 92 stimulations avec les rappels pour les garçons et jusqu'à 110 pour les filles selon Michel Georget! Son livre '""Vaccinations, les vérités indésirables': http://amzn.to/2uGO4H1. 

Selon Michel Georget il y a aussi un problème de rigueur scientifique car il n'y a pas d'étude pharmacocinétique, c'est à dire qu'on ne sait pas ce que deviennent dans notre corps les produits injectés ! Alors que pour tout médicament mis sur le marché, des études rigoureuses sont obligatoires. Or, pour Michel Georget, cela permettrait de voir que l'aluminium contenu dans certains vaccins se fixe parfois dans des endroits indésirables (cerveau, muscles,etc.) et devient responsable de certaines maladies comme la myofasciite à macrophages.

Le vaccin le plus dangereux était celui contre la variole, suivi à présent de la valence de la Coqueluche et celle de l'Hépatite B. Mais également la conjonction des vaccinations, car certains pédiatres font sur un enfant d'un côté le vaccin hexavalent et de l'autre le vaccin Pneumocoque (Prevenar 13), dans la même séance ! Ce qui constitue pour Michel Georget une surcharge certaine pour l'organisme des enfants et peut conduire à une réaction inflammatoire brutale pouvant conduire à la mort.

Michel Georget regrette également que la mort d'un enfant à Barcelone de la dyphtérie, et celle d'un autre enfant de la rougeole à Berlin aientt complètement éclipsé la mort de 3 nourrissons suite à l'injection simultané de l'hexavalent et du prévenar.

Enfin, il pense que nos fonctions biologiques peuvent à terme être atteintes par ces surcharges vaccinales. Pour preuve l'augmentation considérable des réactions allergiques, des allergies d'une part et une augmentation des maladies auto-immunes d'autre part, notamment celle que l'on ne trouvait avant que chez les adultes mais maintenant présentes chez les enfants dès 3 ou 4 ans.


Son livre '""Vaccinations, les vérités indésirables': http://amzn.to/2uGO4H1. La qualité première de ce livre est de nous rendre lucides. L'auteur éclaire de façon incontestable certaines zones obscures de ce qui touche, en nous, l'essentiel : notre santé. Nous devrions tous lire cet ouvrage. À plus forte raison si nous avons des enfants. Mais aussi pour nous-mêmes, afin de pouvoir juger de l'opportunité de les accepter ou de les refuser et, pour les vaccinations obligatoires, obtenir la liberté totale de choix comme c'est le cas dans la plupart des pays européens.

Making the right choices about vaccinating your children is not an easy one and involves both individual choices and an overall plan: what are your own beliefs about what is best for your child? What are the local rules and mandates in your state that you will face? How do you want to work with your pediatrician or other health service providers? How do you want to work with day care services and the school system? Ultimately, what is the overall vaccination schedule you want to choose for your child?

Some of our friends are against vaccination on principle; we are not, but we respect their position. Like them, we support choice as the bedrock of health freedom; but that choice includes the freedom to vaccinate, and a lot of parents are going to choose to vaccinate. They should not be left without unbiased information on how to provide vaccines they choose to give their own children.

So the first thing to understand is this truly is your choice – not ours (we’re not recommending any specific schedule here), not any one doctor’s, and certainly not the government’s. This is America, after all, the land of the free and the home of the brave – which you’ll need to be as you think and act for yourselves about this fraught topic. It’s impossible to avoid hearing dire talk about “requirements,” about ”firing” parents from medical practices or expelling kids from school if they don’t follow the letter of the federal vaccine chart.

But as citizens, we still hold the keys to choices affecting our offspring, and we do not hand them over to anybody in return for the right to a public education or any other inducement. The starting point for the discussion is freedom of speech and freedom of choice, and the fact that parents are in charge when it comes to decisions involving their children as long as those decisions don’t hinder their health or wellbeing. Given the well-founded concerns we’ve demonstrated about individual vaccines – as well as the bloated childhood immunization schedule -- making careful vaccination choices hardly counts as jeopardizing kids’ health. In fact, the real threat is not stepping out of line but mindlessly toeing it, at least when your child’s wellbeing is on the line.

Past organizations that he has lectured for include the International Chiropractic Pediatric Association, the International College of Integrative Medicine, the Hahnemann Academy of North America, and the Culture of Life Institute. Mr. Miller has a degree in psychology and is a member of Mensa.

 

Mr. Miller began his crusade against mandatory vaccines when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Very little data could be found on this topic. His search for the truth led him to scientific journals where numerous studies warned that vaccines are often unsafe and ineffective. His shock and anger at the suppression of this information culminated in his passionate defense of parents seeking to make truly informed vaccine decisions while retaining the right to accept or reject them.

""I cannot think of anything more insane than vaccinating pregnant women...''
Russell L. Blaylock

Dr. Blaylock is a board certified neurosurgeon. He attended the LSU School of Medicine in New Orleans and completed his general surgical internship and neurosurgical residency at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, South Carolina.

During his residency training he worked with the eminent neurosurgeon, Dr. Ludwig Kempe. Together they developed the transcallosal removal of intraventricular tumors, which is still used today. 

Dr. Blaylock has written and illustrated three books. Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills, Health and Nutrition Secrets That Can Save Your Life and Natural Strategies for Cancer Patients. He has written and illustrated chapters in medical textbooks and has also written over 30 scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals on a number of subjects.",Featured Channels,"['UCxscQY7X0mtnaCbkGTjZ17g', 'UCTbv00llRk6swnpCjrXiAhg', 'UCVEaFSr-jdTa_QE4PPSkVJw', 'UCCs_FjJR8A7rompHCnW0-3g', 'UCvsye7V9psc-APX6wV1twLg', 'UCAZaby1ZmxU50mfBPnZY0nQ', 'UCn69KK7NvjJngJR9XP_smFw', 'UChnfZR7JhyDuPr99VHbFIqA', 'UCqTC6nv9WMGJj__i-Wqf1lA', 'UCuMvMKznmiAjx-1hDZf5cCA', 'UCbZGCljWmswTqX5VoYhHxSQ', 'UChwwoeOZ3EJPobW83dgQfAg', 'UC2Xd902w9u5_2oa7SHFSvZw', 'UCpgvIebAMVqdN8kvYxzLBfw', 'UCK9-yEyYhuidgdqV0aFJ8CQ', 'UC7OhkkoVDVBc0aBmyA-m1Vg', 'UC3r0f8a9LXNlD_FCqAr3Ubg', 'UC7TvL4GlQyMBLlUsTrN_C4Q', 'UCu1CepJGKypinrhLmwdbEIQ', 'UC8AYV0dqrG0j_MFXBlkPrJA']",False,UCPvDn8vvYN6rk890faj8RMg,39500,Russell Blaylock M.D,UUPvDn8vvYN6rk890faj8RMg,105,3888935,37.0,,,hd,"Malzberg Show - Dr. Blaylock shares his views on mandating vaccinations.  Vaccinations should not be mandated as they have never been proven to be 100% safe nor effective.  There is compelling scientific evidence showing that vaccinations are not as safe as the pharmaceutical industry-sponsored mainstream media are suggesting.  Significant serious complications such as death, seizures, encephalitis and brain damage can occur as a result of vaccination, all this is well documented in the medical literature and such complications are more frequent than the pharmaceutical industry-sponsored mainstream media would have people believe.

No one has the right to force parents to vaccinate especially when it is well documented in scientific studies demonstrating the mechanisms by which vaccinations can cause harm to children.

If it could be demonstrated that vaccinations were 100% safe and do not cause any adverse effects or harm, then it would be a different story. However, this cannot be demonstrated and the scientific evidence is clearly showing that vaccinations are continuing to cause complications..

Since the increase in the vaccination schedule, there appears to also be a correlation between the increase in auto-immune disease, neurological damage, impairment in learning, memory and speech linked to vaccination. 

The argument for mandating vaccination is that non-vaccinated children put other children at risk of disease  But if the vaccinations are as effective as the pharmaceutical companies suggest, why does it matter if other children are not vaccinated? If the vaccines are supposed  to prevent the child from getting the disease anyway? This is a poor argument, but it makes a lot of money for the pharmaceutical industries who sponsor the media and lobby politicians to support mandating their vaccinations. 

When the evidence for outbreaks like measles are examined we find that most of the children in these outbreaks were already fully vaccinated and that the vaccines are in fact no where near as effective as what the pharmaceutical companies are claiming. Many of these diseases such as measles and chicken pox are not fatal diseases in western countries, only in poor countries where there is lack of nutrition and the children there have compromised immune systems.",2d,18.0,PT5M53S,[],1GHDHq7FSxg,300.0,rectangular,"['Health (Industry)', 'Vaccine (Drug Class)', 'Russell Blaylock (Physician)', 'mandate']",Dr.  Russell Blaylock Shares His Take on the Ongoing Vaccine Debate,11064,"['Mercola', 'NVICstandup', 'Truthstream Media', 'Gerald Celente', 'Channel not found.', 'Channel not found.', 'Gary Null', 'LibertyFellowshipMT', 'Gerson Institute', 'VACTRUTH', 'fluoridealert', 'WeAreChange', 'breakingtheset', 'NaturalSolutions', 'BIO INNOVATIONS', 'Channel not found.', 'ExperimentalVaccines', 'corbettreport', 'Anthony Gucciardi', 'Channel not found.']"

""I support children getting vaccinations and I also support families having the right to make educated medical decisions for their children alongside their physicians."" Biel explained her concerns with SB 276, a California bill that seeks to limit medical exemptions for vaccinations. “My dearest friends have a child with a medical condition that warrants an exemption from vaccinations, and should this bill pass, it would greatly affect their family's ability to care for their child in this state,"" Biel's post continued.

Healing the child from the vaccine injury required years and years of alternative medicine (natural medicine) treatment. His other child also suffered from vaccines and because of these vaccine reactions, he decided not to vaccinate his children. Interestingly, he moved to California five years ago to ensure he could secure a personal belief exemption to vaccination because where he had lived - New Jersey - he could not get a personal belief exemption or religious exemption from vaccination in order to attend school. However, currently in California a bill has been introduced which would eliminate personal belief exemptions: it is called SB 277. You can imagine his pain.

His doctors wouldn’t help him understand the vaccine damage that occurred, which is why he turned to natural medicine doctors for help, and natural medicine ultimately helped recover his son. He determined that vaccines are NOT safe, and stopped vaccinating his children. He believes that vaccines have toxins that would harm his children. He is also not worried about childhood diseases because his children are in good health and therefore they will be able to recover from a childhood illness. He recommends that parents research diseases and the history of childhood diseases to understand why vaccines are neither safe nor effective: http://www.stopmandatoryvaccination.com/public-health/

The Democrat-led Senate and Assembly voted Thursday to repeal the exemption, which allows parents to cite religious beliefs to forego getting their child the vaccines required for school enrollment.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the measure minutes after the final vote. The law takes effect immediately but will give unvaccinated students up to 30 days after they enter a school to show they've had the first dose of each required immunization.

With New York's move, similar exemptions are still allowed in 45 states, though lawmakers in several of them have introduced their own legislation to eliminate the waiver.

The issue is hotly contested and debate around it has often been emotional, pitting cries that religious freedom is being curtailed against warnings that public health is being endangered. After the vote in the Assembly, many of those watching from the gallery erupted in cries of ""shame!"" One woman yelled obscenities down to the lawmakers below.

The debate has only intensified with this year's measles outbreak , which federal officials recently said has surpassed 1,000 illnesses, the highest in 27 years.

""I'm not aware of anything in the Torah, the Bible, the Koran or anything else that suggests you should not get vaccinated,"" said Bronx Democrat Jeffrey Dinowitz, the bill's Assembly sponsor. ""If you choose to not vaccinate your child, therefore potentially endangering other children ... then you're the one choosing not to send your children to school.""

Hundreds of parents of unvaccinated children gathered at New York's Capitol for the vote to protest.

Stan Yung, a Long Island attorney and father, said his Russian Orthodox religious views and health concerns about vaccines will prevent him from vaccinating his three young children. His family, he said, may consider leaving the state.

""People came to this country to get away from exactly this kind of stuff,"" Yung said ahead of Thursday's votes.

Supporters of the bill say religious beliefs about vaccines shouldn't eclipse scientific evidence that they work, noting the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1905 that states have the right to enforce compulsory vaccination laws. During the Assembly's floor debate, supporters brought up scourges of the past that were defeated in the U.S. through vaccines.

""I'm old enough to have been around when polio was a real threat,"" said Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, D-Manhattan. ""I believe in science.... Your personal opinions, which may be based on junk science, do not trump the greater good.""

Supporters also suggest some parents may be claiming the religious exemption for their children even though their opposition is actually based on scientifically discredited claims about the dangers of vaccines.

The bill would not change an existing state exemption given to children who cannot have vaccines for medical reasons, such as a weakened immune system.

Cuomo told reporters on Wednesday that he believes public health — and the need to protect those who cannot get vaccinated because for medical reasons — outweighs the concerns about religious freedom.

""I understand freedom of religion,"" he said. ""I have heard the anti-vaxxers' theory, but I believe both are overwhelmed by the public health risk.""

The current measles outbreak has renewed concern about the exemptions in many states. The nation last saw as many cases in 1992, when more than 2,200 were reported.

The majority of cases are from outbreaks in New York in Orthodox Jewish communities.

California removed personal belief vaccine exemptions for children in both public and private schools in 2015, after a measles outbreak at Disneyland sickened 147 people and spread across the U.S. and into Canada. Maine ended its religious exemption earlier this year.

Mississippi and West Virginia also do not allow religious exemptions.

Once common in the U.S., measles became rare after vaccination campaigns that started in the 1960s. A decade ago, there were fewer than 100 cases a year.

The first post of this nature was on January 15, 2011 in response to a court ordering a mother to have her 5 year old daughter vaccinated.
Dorey wailed, ""Court orders rape of a child. Think this is an exaggeration? This is assault without consent and full penetration too..."".
See screenshot:
https://reasonablehank.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/avn-6944-dorey-rape-with-full-penetration-january-2011.jpg
The result was an immediate loss of members followed by a puerile insistence by Dorey that some archaic definitions that list ""plunder, despoil, seize and carry off by force"" as types of rape justify her comment.
This time again disgusted page members rose in large number to condemn such an affront to reason with at least one member publicly announcing she would be quitting Dorey's page immediately. Once the media got hold of the story the post was deleted, and childish lies claiming innocence began to surface - to great amusement on social media.

Dorey has reacted again, by predictably presenting her ""dictionary"" to insist rape is merely general medieval abuse - despite the image she used of a man attacking a woman from behind with the words, ""Forced Penetration. Really it's no big deal if it's just a vaccination needle and he's a doctor - do you really need control over your own choices?""
Incredibly, AVSN group leader Meryl Dorey, and Tasha David the current so-called ""president"" insist their page does not belong to the group - even though they hold administration privileges.
They pleaded innocence, further demolishing their credibility by insisting they have ""no control"" over what appears on the page - albeit content contains their signatures.
AUSTRALIAN DOCTOR reported on the public statement posted on the groups Facebook page with input from Meryl Dorey pushing the evidence-free myth that vaccines kill large numbers of children. 

""Australian Doctor attempted to contact the AVSN by phone, however the number listed for the organisation on its webpage was disconnected.
The group — based in Bangalow on the NSW north coast and formerly known as the Australian Vaccination Network — made a public statement over Facebook disowning any relationship between the AVSN Facebook page and the actual organisation.
It admitted the image posted was in poor taste but also queried why there was such great media interest in the meme when they apparently ignored “children who are killed"".
AVSN spokeswoman Meryl Dorey said: “I agree that the image was very much in-your-face and should not have been posted here, but I am also (once again) floored that this has become a media issue whilst the children who are killed and permanently injured, and their families that are often destroyed, remain in the shadows as far as the press is concerned.
'Let's get back to the issue at hand and agree that the important thing to do is to focus on the immorality of forced vaccination.' ""

Il y dénonce la vaccination pratiquée à outrance contre des maladies bénignes : la rougeole par exemple. Saviez-vous que la vaccination contre la rougeole n'a jamais permis l'éradication de la maladie, puisqu'elle avait déjà disparu bien avant la mise en place de la campagne de masse ? Saviez-vous que les Pays-Bas ont toujours refusé la vaccination BCG, et que l'épidémie de tuberculose y a diminué bien plus rapidement qu'en France, même en prenant en compte la différence du nombre d'habitants ?

Mais en plus de cela, la vaccination peut se révêler dangereuse. Déjà, parce que loin d'empêcher le vacciné de contracter la maladie, elle augmente ses chances de la contracter effectivement. Prenons actuellement une recrudescence de la rougeole chez les adultes particulièrement virulente ; c'est un effet secondaire du vaccin, qui n'a pas permis à une immunité naturelle de se former.

En Finlande, la poliomyélite n'existait plus depuis 20 ans, la vaccination généralisée a fait réintroduire 10 cas dans les années 1980, bien plus agressifs que la maladie normale. Là-bas, les autorités sanitaires moins soumises aux laboratoires ont fait retirer la vaccination anti-poliomyélite.

It stops them suffering from diseases that can be fatal. Vaccine side effects are one of the hot topics at the moment in both human and pet health. What are the real risks of vaccination in dogs and cats?

No, vaccines do not cause autism in dogs, cats or people. If you really believe a Dr who has been struck off for falsifying research data then I can't help you!

Vaccines do come with some risks however. Most are mild, nothing more than the body reacting to a perceived infection. There is though a very small chance of more serious side effects that you should be aware of such as anaphylactic reaction and injection site tumor.

It's important not to overexaggerate the risks of these though when the risk of not vaccinating is certainly much much greater for the vast majority of pet dogs and cats.

I've made this video in collaboration with Public Health England to support the NHS and all of its hard working amazing staff this winter. 

Flu leads to hundreds of thousands of GP visits and tens of thousands of hospital stays a year. In the UK an average of 8,000 people die per year from complications of flu. Last year flu killed 15,000 people and the year before that it was 16,000 people.

Apart from protecting individual people, getting the flu vaccine helps to reduce the spread of the disease, and so reduces the chance of passing on the flu virus to other people who may be at risk of flu.

If you are eligible for the free NHS flu vaccine, let's play our part and get vaccinated to support the NHS and all of its hard working amazing staff this winter. Help spread the word to friends and family by sharing this video.

WHAT IS FLU:
Flu (influenza) is a common infectious viral illness spread by coughs and sneezes. For healthy adults under the age of 65 it can be very unpleasant,  you begin to feel better within about a week.

You can catch flu all year round, but it's especially common in winter, which is why it's also known as seasonal flu.

Some of the main symptoms of flu include:

• High temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
• Extreme tiredness and weakness
• Headache
• General aches and pains
• Dry, chesty cough
• Cold-like symptoms

Flu can make you feel so exhausted and unwell that you have to stay in bed and rest until you feel better.

WHO SHOULD GET THE FLU VACCINE:
Flu can lead to serious complications and death, especially for people in risk groups. In rare cases flu can kill people who are otherwise healthy.

In the UK the NHS flu vaccine is available each year from late September or early October onwards. If you are in the risk group It is recommended to get the flu vaccine in the autumn, before outbreaks of flu have started. It takes up to two weeks after vaccination for you to be protected against flu.

The inactivated flu vaccine does not contain any live flu viruses and cannot give you flu. In the 2018-19 season, two different types of inactivated flu vaccine will be offered in the UK.

• Those aged 65 or over will be offered a trivalent flu vaccine (protecting against three strains of flu virus) which also contains an adjuvant.
• Those aged under 64 years in eligible groups will be offered a quadrivalent flu vaccine (protecting against four strains of flu virus).

WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE FREE NHS FLU VACCINE:
• Children aged 2 and 3
• Children in reception class and school years 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
• Children aged 2 to 17 years at risk of flu
• Anyone aged 65 and over
• Pregnant women
• Children and adults with an underlying health condition (such as long-term heart or respiratory disease)
• Children and adults with weakened immune systems

Please click the following link to see the full list of those eligible for the free NHS flu vaccine: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/who-should-have-flu-vaccine/

WHERE CAN YOU GET THE FREE NHS FLU VACCINE
• Your local pharmacy
• Your GP surgery
• Your midwifery service if they offer it for pregnant women
• Most children will be offered the flu vaccine at school: For more information please visit: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/child-flu-vaccine/

The Democrat-led Senate and Assembly voted Thursday to repeal the exemption, which allows parents of children to cite their religious beliefs to opt a child out of the vaccines required for school enrollment.

Soon after, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the measure.

Similar exemptions are allowed in 46 states, though lawmakers in several of them are also considering the elimination of the waiver.

""We are facing an unprecedented public health crisis,"" said Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan and the sponsor of the legislation in the Senate. ""The atrocious peddlers of junk science and fraudulent medicine who we know as anti-vaxxers have spent years sowing unwarranted doubt and fear, but it is time for legislators to confront them head on.""

Hundreds of parents of unvaccinated children gathered at New York's Capitol before the vote to protest what several called an assault on religious freedom.

Vaccines work by presenting a foreign antigen to the immune system to evoke an immune response, but there are several ways to do this. Four main types are currently in clinical use:

    An inactivated vaccine consists of virus or bacteria that are grown in culture and then killed using a method such as heat or formaldehyde. Although the virus or bacteria particles are destroyed and cannot replicate, the virus capsid proteins or bacterial wall are intact enough to be recognized and remembered by the immune system and evoke a response. When manufactured correctly, the vaccine is not infectious, but improper inactivation can result in intact and infectious particles. Since the properly produced vaccine does not reproduce, booster shots are required periodically to reinforce the immune response.
    In an attenuated vaccine, live virus or bacteria with very low virulence are administered. They will replicate, but locally or very slowly. Since they do reproduce and continue to present antigen to the immune system beyond the initial vaccination, boosters may be required less often. These vaccines may be produced by passaging, for example, adapting a virus into different host cell cultures, such as in animals, or at suboptimal temperatures, allowing selection of less virulent strains, or by mutagenesis or targeted deletions in genes required for virulence. There is a small risk of reversion to virulence, which is smaller in vaccines with deletions. Attenuated vaccines also cannot be used by immunocompromised individuals. Reversions of virulence were described for a few attenuated viruses of chickens (infectious bursal disease virus, avian infectious bronchitis virus, avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus [3], avian metapneumovirus [4])[21]
    Virus-like particle vaccines consist of viral protein(s) derived from the structural proteins of a virus. These proteins can self-assemble into particles that resemble the virus from which they were derived but lack viral nucleic acid, meaning that they are not infectious. Because of their highly repetitive, multivalent structure, virus-like particles are typically more immunogenic than subunit vaccines (described below). The human papillomavirus and Hepatitis B virus vaccines are two virus-like particle-based vaccines currently in clinical use.
    A subunit vaccine presents an antigen to the immune system without introducing viral particles, whole or otherwise. One method of production involves isolation of a specific protein from a virus or bacterium (such as a bacterial toxin) and administering this by itself. A weakness of this technique is that isolated proteins may have a different three-dimensional structure than the protein in its normal context, and will induce antibodies that may not recognize the infectious organism. In addition, subunit vaccines often elicit weaker antibody responses than the other classes of vaccines.

A number of other vaccine strategies are under experimental investigation. These include DNA vaccination and recombinant viral vectors. Source of the article published in description is Wikipedia. I am sharing their material. Copyright by original content developers of Wikipedia.

Free trade and globalization tend to provide an overall benefit, and raises average incomes across the globe. The downside is that it isn't good for every individual in the system. In some countries, manufacturing jobs move to places where labor costs are lower. And some countries that receive the influx of jobs aren't prepared to deal with it, from a regulatory standpoint. Anyway, Jacob and Adriene can explain the whole thing to you in 10 minutes.

She said the model thrashed out during the marathon away-day would allow Britain to 'avoid friction' that could harm business while preventing a hard Irish border. But amid signs the EU will immediately reject the ideas, the Cabinet also agreed to step up planning for 'no deal'. ‘Today in detailed discussions the Cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU,' Mrs May said. ‘Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve.'

A common belief is that big companies will sell below cost to drive out their competitors and then raise their prices.  This is a fallacy and there are few professional economists who believe otherwise. Historian Thomas E. Woods offers a simple explanation in this video: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6dD-ifIr8s

For an example of the steel industry's anti-free enterprise rhetoric listen to Dan DiMicco, CEO of Nucor, one of the largest steel producers in the United States, during this interview with Lesley Stahl of '60 minutes'. In this example, just as Dr. Friedman professed, Nucor benefits at the expense of Caterpillar which relies not only on steel, but exports as well.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYyrqSmhals

The anti-free trade protectionists will say we need exports to create American jobs. But, they say, we need tariffs and import quotas to protect American jobs from ""unfair"" competition. This is another fallacy as Dr. Friedman explains. When you impose tariffs on imports you hurt exports as well! To understand this better read the following:

That Which is Seen and That Which is Not Seen by Frédéric Bastiat
http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html

We hear many people constantly lamenting the fact that the American manufacturing sector is dead or dying. (Just read the comments section of this video!) This has been repeated so often that it has become conventional wisdom. This is another myth not supported by any evidence. In fact, the data shows the opposite is true: America is BY FAR the world's largest manufacturing nation. Our output is higher now than it has EVER been in history.

Even though this video focuses on the steel industry, it applies to all others as well. Did you know that American consumers pay, on average, twice the world price for sugar? Once again, special interests benefit at the expense of everyone else. Read:

America consumes billions of dollars of apparel every year. Chances are, your apparel of choice wasn’t made in the United States, but thousands of miles away in countries such as China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh.

Over the last few decades, fashion has become a global industry, affecting manufacturers, workers, retailers, and consumers alike. While your choice of fashion may appear to be superficial, the questions surrounding the industry deal with important political, economic, and moral issues.

How is fashion affected by trade policies? Are tariffs effective in promoting domestic industry? Do free trade agreements help those who take part in them? Lawyers, law professors, and industry experts explore the complicated issues surrounding the apparel industry.

Free trade lets nations concentrate on manufacturing their specialties, which are typically products other nations can’t make or produce as well. With revenues from selling such goods, nations can buy products from other nations that they need.
For example, say two countries sit across an ocean from one another. One specializes in raising beef, but has fallen behind in technological fields. The other country makes some of the world’s best electronics, but needs more beef. The two nations enter into a free trade agreement. Each lowers tariffs exporters must pay and begin importing the other’s specialty.
There are instances where governments restrict free trade in order to support local businesses and boost employment. But free trade is largely considered beneficial for nations that participate. It enables them to focus on core competitive advantages, thereby maximizing economic output and fostering growth.
Nations like China and India started expanding faster when they adopted free trade principles in the 1980s and 1990s. Many nations are members of the World Trade Organization, which aims to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably and freely as possible.

TRANSCRIPT:
Deirdre M.:
You can't get a better deal than, more or less, free trade. That's where we've moved. I mean, after the war every country was protectionist. There were no free trade countries. Even the old free trade company Britain had long since 30 years before become a protectionist country.
 Since then, we've been moving steadily towards free trade and it's been very good for the poor of the world. This idea that the poor made worse off by free trade is just lunacy.

Dave Rubin:
Interesting.

Deirdre M.:
It's a wage per what you can get with the wage is the key point. What you can get with a wage has steadily increased even though you've heard people say, ""Oh, things are getting worse."" No, they're not.

Dave Rubin:
Yeah.

Deirdre M.:
The sky is not falling. Manufacturing jobs in the United States peaked in 1977. They've been going down ever since. Why? Is it because of China, Mexico? Not much. That's maybe 10% of the loss jobs. The jobs are being lost either to other Americans moving to California or Texas, especially in Texas, or to automation. Just as you said the store, the bricks-and-mortar store for Amazon has no people in it.

Dave Rubin:
Yeah.

Deirdre M.:
Well, that's what's happening and that's a good thing not a bad thing. The purpose of the economy is not to make jobs. Jobs are infinite. We can make construction workers use teaspoons instead of shovels and that will make for more jobs.

Dave Rubin:
Right.

Deirdre M.:
The purpose of an economy is to get more goods and services, so that we have the leisure to pursue our hobbies and to educate ourselves. Suppose we just cut off foreign trade entirely. I know that's not his proposal, but suppose we just walled off the United States. Well then, every American would be poor, every single American.

It seems millions of people claim to have been at Woodstock when only 500,000 or so were really there, but the biggest pop-culture event of the 1960s has nothing on one of the most pivotal of the 1970s: The Sex Pistols' appearance at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester, England, on June 4, 1976. Proportional to the actual crowd in attendance, perhaps no event in the history of pop music has enjoyed greater retroactive audience growth than the one that's been called ""The gig that changed the world.""
 
By June 1976, the Sex Pistols had been playing together under that name for only seven months, and though their look, their sound and their nihilistic attitude were already in place, they and the entire British punk scene were still a few months away from truly breaking out. They had drawn just enough attention in the British music press, though, to inspire two young men from Manchester named Howard DeVoto and Pete Shelley to go down and see them play in London in February. From this experience, two things happened: DeVoto and Shelley arranged for the Sex Pistols to come up north and play the Lesser Free Trade Hall; and then they formed their own new band, called the Buzzcocks. News of the June 4 gig in Manchester spread mostly by word of mouth, such that on the night of the show, perhaps as few as 40 people showed up in a room that could hold hundreds. In that small crowd, however, were some names that would help shape the course of pop music over the next decade:
 
Howard DeVoto and Pete Shelley: Their band, the Buzzcocks, would go on to enjoy enormous popularity and influence in the UK both during and after the punk era.
 
Ian Curtis, Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook: The very next day, Hook would buy his first guitar, and the three young Mancunians would become a band.

Prior to World War II, states routinely taxed goods imported into their country. Although this makes domestic products more competitive within the country's own borders, the tariff system led to an overall inefficient economic system. Why were taxes the norm back then, and why is it so difficult to establish free trade?

Modeling free trade as a prisoner's dilemma provides an explanation. Although everyone is collectively better off with free trade, individual incentives tell states to place tariffs on imported goods. Thus, although the result is collectively crazy, it is individually rational.

Yet, in the post-World War II era, free trade has become the norm. As such, this video raises a new question: how is free trade sustainable given the prisoner's dilemma logic?

In response, Mr Johnson said it would be similar to Switzerland’s relationship with the European Union.

Switzerland is not part of the EU however it has signed up to a plethora of agreements and directives including free movement of people.

“There are examples of just-in-time supply chains that operate with a high-degree of efficiency over customs union differentials – there is no reason why that can’t be done”, he said.

“That should not be an obstacle to us properly taking back control, delivering what the British people voted for and doing great free-trade deals and seizing back control of our destiny.”

“The Chequers proposals manifestly fail to do that”, Mr Johnson added.

The current global downturn is no exception. Protectionist barriers have shot up all over the world, including the United States.

Last year, Congress killed a pilot program allowing Mexican trucks to transport goods across America and included Buy America provisions in the stimulus bill banning foreign steel and iron from infrastructure projects funded by the legislation. 

More disturbingly, President Barack Obama, after chiding Congress for flirting with protectionism, initiated his own ill-advised affair by imposing a 35 percent tariff on cheap Chinese tires. 

If the world manages to avoid an all-out trade war of the kind that helped trigger the Great Depression after the U.S. imposed the Smoot-Hawley tariffs in 1930, it will be in no small part due to the efforts of one man: Jagdish N. Bhagwati, an ebullient and irreverent 76-year-old professor of economics at Columbia University. 

Bhagwati has done more than perhaps any other person alive to advance the cause of unfettered global trade. A native of India, Bhagwati immigrated to the United States in the late 60s after a brief stint on the Indian Planning Commission, where he learned first-hand the insanity of an economic approach that tried to modernize a country by cutting it off from world trade.

Since then, he has devoted his efforts, both in academia and in the popular press, to showing that there is no better way of improving the lot of both advanced countries and the developing world than through free trade. His path-breaking contributions to trade theory have put him on the short list for a Nobel Prize in economics. 

Though a dogged trade advocate, Bhagwati is anything but dogmatic. He is a free spirit who draws intellectual inspiration from many disparate ideological camps. A self-avowed liberal, he is also something of a Gandhian social progressive, though Gandhi himself supported economic autarky. Bhagwati works with numerous Third World NGOs on a host of human rights issues. Yet he has no problem taking on these groups - or his famous student, Nobel laureate Paul Krugman - when they question the benefits of trade. 

In fact, he devoted his 2004 magnum opus, In Defense of Globalization, to a point-by-point rebuttal of these critics. Although he doesnt vote Republican because he dislikes the partys nationalistic jingoism, he readily declares that Democrats pose a far bigger threat to international exchange than Republicans. 

Last summer, Shikha Dalmia, a senior analyst at the Reason Foundation, interviewed Bhagwati in his New York office. For a transcript of that interview, go to http://reason.com.

This video interview was filmed on the same day and conducted by Dalmia, Reason Associate Editor Damon W. Root, and Reason.tv's Dan Hayes, who shot and edited the video. Approximately 6 minutes.

Free trade agreements are designed to improve business links with important partners around the world. In addition to the EFTA agreement and the free trade agreement with the European Union, Switzerland currently has a network of 28 free trade agreements, and new agreements are continually being negotiated.
Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) make life easier, because they minimize or eliminate barriers to international markets. The essential component of every agreement is trade in merchandise, which reduces or eliminates customs duties and other trade restrictions. Trade and unprocessed agricultural products tend to be regulated at separated agricultural agreements. There are also so-called second generation agreements. These include the protection of intellectual property rights, trade and services, investments, public procurement and technical regulations. Did you know that no other country has as large a network of FTAs as Switzerland has? In 2012 trade with only five important EU countries resulted in duty savings of 1 billion Swiss francs. Did you also know that 51 % of Switzerland's exports to markets outside the EU are realized through FTA? FTA offers several benefits. Most important, they promote the growth, added value and competitiveness of Switzerland as a business location. Swiss exporters and importers benefit from the savings in customs duties. Here's an example of an FTA's benefits: let's say you are the export manager of a Swiss manufacturer of dishwashers. Your company is only active in Europe and you want to export to China. So you call the experts at Switzerland Global Enterprise. We are pleased to inform you that you can save up to 14 % in customs duties for your dishwasher if it meets the specific rules of origin of the FTA between Switzerland and China. In this example, the value criterion allows a maximum share of 50 % by a third country. Remember: your European competitor pays 14 % in custom expenses as long as the EU doesn't have an FTA with China. Let's say your merchandise value is 100000 Swiss francs: this means with an FTA you save 14000 Swiss francs in customs duties. And it's easy! Your company creates a proof of origin and ships the goods to China. The result? You are happy because your Chinese client is happy, and we are happy to help you. Switzerland Global Enterprise offers a wide range of support measures, events, online tools, expert database, studies and fact sheets, customs tariffs worldwide and our FTA map for the best overview.

__

Many people assume that importing goods from other countries destroys jobs here in the U.S. IS that true?  Economists believe that trade doesn't destroy jobs, it just moves them around within the economy. The idea is that trading with other nations lowers consumer prices, and those consumers buy things they couldn't have afforded before - creating jobs to replace those lost to trade.

It created a free trade area of 1.6 billion people in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The seven foreign ministers of the region signed a framework agreement on SAFTA to reduce customs duties of all traded goods to zero by the year 2016.
The SAFTA agreement came into force on 1 January 2006 and is operational following the ratification of the agreement by the seven governments. SAFTA requires the developing countries in South Asia to bring their duties down to 20 percent in the first phase of the two-year period ending in 2007. In the final five-year phase ending 2012, the 20 percent duty will be reduced to zero in a series of annual cuts. The least developed nations in South Asia have an additional three years to reduce tariffs to zero. India and Pakistan ratified the treaty in 2009, whereas Afghanistan as the 8th memberstate of the SAARC ratified the SAFTA protocol on the 4th of May 2011.

Delivering his annual 'State of the Union' speech in the US Congress on Tuesday, Obama supported a bilateral agreement that would encompass half the world's economic output.

""Tonight I am announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union because trade that is free and fair across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs."" said US President Barak Obama.

The United States and the European Union already have the largest economic relationship in the world, worth over 2 billion euros per day.

But facing increased competition from emerging economies, both allies have been exploring ways to deepen their relations. 

""A future deal between the world's two most important economic powers will be a game-changer, giving a strong boost to our economies on both sides of the Atlantic."" 
""For these negotiations to succeed, we need -- above all -- political will: a desire to make our rules and regulations compatible, and to cut tariffs whenever it makes sense and is possible.""
""The Commission will move quickly to present a negotiating mandate to our Member States so we can start negotiations as soon as possible, still during the Irish Presidency of the Council."",  said EC's president Jose Manuel Barroso.

The European Commission said on Wednesday that they aim to complete negotiations by 2015. 

""Ideally, we'd like to complete this work in about two years from now -- but, more paramount than speed is achieving an ambitious deal.""

""Our main focus has to be to tackle those barriers which are behind the customs border -- such as differences in technical regulations, standards and certifications. These often cost time and money. This is where we can make real savings for our businesses and bring better value for consumers."", said EU commissioner for Trade Karel de Gucht.

Rwandan President Paul Kagame said while opening the Africa CEO Forum at the Kigali Convention Center in Rwanda that 21 countries had ratified the Continental Free Trade Area.

Ethiopia last week took the agreement through Parliament, becoming the 21st country to do so.

For the trade deal that would create a market of $3 trillion and a market of 1.2 billion people with no tariff and border restrictions to be enforceable, 22 countries are required to ratify. The deal was negotiated over two years before being signed in Kigali last year.

American jobs were sent to China, Mexico and the third world, and the only solution is to bring the jobs home again. There is no national wealth in selling Chinese products to each other, we must build our cars, computers, technology and other products here, and stop importing Chinese food too.

America's wealth was ""outsourced"" along with our jobs. This is why what would have been a minor financial problem became a world-wide crisis. America is hollowed out, the economy we built with factories and high-paying jobs is gone and we lived the last couple decades on ""credit cards""--Chinese loans. The ONLY solution is to scrap WTO and NAFTA and rebuild OUR economy. The economy was strong BEFORE NAFTA and WTO, they are the source of today's collapse.

Canada has negotiated the Canada-Korea
         Free Trade Agreement.
         It is projected to boost our economy by $1.7 billion,
         creating thousands of jobs for hard-working Canadians.
         It will also serve as a gateway into
         the larger Asia-Pacific region.
         Meet Bill Wymenga and Bruce Pollock,
         two Canadian business people who will benefit.
         This is what they have to say about the
         Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement.
         I&apos;m a pork producer here in Chatham-Kent.
         I produce market hogs for Conestoga Meats.
         Our company is an exporter of structural building materials -
         lumber and panel products that go to overseas markets,
         mainly the Pacific Rim.
         In our case, we&apos;ve figured that this would be worth
         about five dollars per hog.
         If I ship twenty-two hundred market hogs a year,
         that&apos;s over ten thousand just in my own personal pocket, and
         I&apos;m not a very large producer so this is very significant.
         If you add that number across Canada where we have
         over 21 million hogs, that are marketed per year,
         we&apos;re talking something over a 100 million dollars.
         The tariff for products from America are 7.2%, ours are 8%.
         When we look at what&apos;s going to happen over the next five years,
         because of the U.S. Free Trade Agreement with Korea,
         theirs will drift to zero and ours will stay the same.
         How can we compete with an 8% disadvantage?
         The South Korean market has been very important
         for us in the past.
         It&apos;s been one of our top five markets that we export

As a teacher of IB Economics in Santiago, Chile, I created Econ Course Companion to help IB Economics students navigate their way through their two-year course of study.  Hopefully, you will find these videos helpful too!

As a former Peace Corps Volunteer, a graduate of Duke University, and someone who has been fortunate enough to have traveled to over 45 countries around world, you will see how those experiences shape my teachings of IB Economics.  Economics is human behavior!  It is as a result of that behavior that economists have something to put into data charts and diagrams to study.  Don't ever forget that!

I have found it to be an excellent resource for students.  Another source you may find helpful is Jason Welker’s site www.econclassroom.com.  Welker’s site and course companions are excellent and have served as another source for these videos.  Thank you Jocelyn, Ian, and Jason.

Tensions are rising in Catalonia. An independence referendum is planned for October 1st and if the majority vote Yes the Catalan government says it will declare independence from Spain.

Raul Romeva is a member of the Catalan parliament, which favours independence. A parliament set on a collision course with the Spanish government.

Xavier Albiol is the leader of the Catalan branch of Spain's ruling People's Party. His party fiercely opposes the referendum that has been deemed illegal by the Spanish constitutional court. Police have raided Catalan government offices, seized ballot papers, and arrested at least 12 officials in a bid to stop the vote.

Catalonia has been part of Spain since the country first emerged as a unified kingdom in 1469. Famous for its spectacular human towers, a tradition dating back to the 18th century, Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest regions incorporating the tourist hub of Barcelona and a thriving manufacturing industry. It already enjoys more self-government than almost any other European region.

So why are many Catalans discontented with their lot?

What does FREE-TRADE AREA mean? FREE-TRADE AREA meaning - FREE-TRADE AREA definition - FREE-TRADE AREA explanation.

Source: Wikipedia.org article, adapted under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ license.

A free-trade area is the region encompassing a trade bloc whose member countries have signed a free-trade agreement (FTA). Such agreements involve cooperation between at least two countries to reduce trade barriers – import quotas and tariffs – and to increase trade of goods and services with each other. If people are also free to move between the countries, in addition to a free-trade agreement, it would also be considered an open border. It can be considered the second stage of economic integration.

Unlike a customs union (the third stage of economic integration), members of a free trade area do not have a common external tariff, which means they have different quotas and customs taxes, as well as other policies with respect to non-members. To avoid tariff evasion (through re-exportation) the countries use the system of certification of origin most commonly called rules of origin, where there is a requirement for the minimum extent of local material inputs and local transformations adding value to the goods. Only goods that meet these minimum requirements are entitled to the special treatment envisioned by the free trade area provisions.

Cumulation is the relationship between different FTAs regarding the rules of origin – sometimes different FTAs supplement each other, in other cases there is no cross-cumulation between the FTAs. A free-trade area is a result of a free-trade agreement (a form of trade pact) between two or more countries. Free-trade areas and agreements (FTAs) are cascadable to some degree – if some countries sign agreements to form a free-trade area and choose to negotiate together (either as a trade bloc or as a forum of individual members of their FTA) another free-trade agreement with another country (or countries) – then the new FTA will consist of the old FTA plus the new country (or countries).

Within an industrialized country there are usually few if any significant barriers to the easy exchange of goods and services between parts of that country. For example, there are usually no trade tariffs or import quotas; there are usually no delays as goods pass from one part of the country to another (other than those that distance imposes); there are usually no differences of taxation and regulation. Between countries, on the other hand, many of these barriers to the easy exchange of goods often do occur. It is commonplace for there to be import duties of one kind or another (as goods enter a country) and the levels of sales tax and regulation often vary by country..

The aim of a free-trade area is to reduce barriers to exchange so that trade can grow as a result of specialisation, division of labour, and most importantly via comparative advantage. The theory of comparative advantage argues that in an unrestricted marketplace (in equilibrium) each source of production will tend to specialize in that activity where it has comparative (rather than absolute) advantage. The theory argues that the net result will be an increase in income and ultimately wealth and well-being for everyone in the free-trade area. But the theory refers only to aggregate wealth and says nothing about the distribution of wealth; in fact there may be significant losers, in particular among the recently protected industries with a comparative disadvantage. In principle, the overall gains from trade could be used to compensate for the effects of reduced trade barriers by appropriate inter-party transfers.",2d,,PT3M59S,['https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/'],hvTR3F0_VWU,,rectangular,"['dictionary', 'english dictionary', 'online dictionary', 'vocabulary', 'english vocabulary', 'online vocabulary', 'how to pronounce words', 'what do words mean', 'free-trade area', 'what is free-trade area', 'free-trade area meaning', 'free-trade area definition', 'free-trade area explanation', 'what is the meaning of free-trade area', 'what is the definition of free-trade area', 'what does free-trade area mean', 'what does free-trade area stand for']",What is FREE-TRADE AREA?

Taking advantage of preferential programs can also create risk of non-compliance due to the complexity of trade rules.
 
This risk or lack of manpower to utilize such programs can be overcome by leveraging technology.

Amber Road’s global trade management software automates the process in 4 steps:

1. Trade agreement identification:
Identification of preferential programs within your global trade lanes and projected cost savings.

2. Supplier solicitation campaigns:
Automated collection of product information from suppliers for rules of origin qualification.

3. Bill of material qualification:
Compilation of supplier’s information in a Bill of Materials certificate to generate the correct customs documentation.

4. Certificate management:
Managing certificates for origin updates, renewals and audits.

Here in America, as we reflect on the many things we have to be grateful for, we should take a moment to recognize that one of the key factors behind our nation's great prosperity is the open trade policy that allows the American people to freely exchange goods and services with free people around the world. The freedom to trade is not a new issue for America. In 1776 our Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence, charging the British with a number of offenses, among them, and I quote, ``cutting off our trade with all parts of the world,'' end quote.
 
And that same year, a Scottish economist named Adam Smith launched another revolution with a book entitled ``The Wealth of Nations,'' which exposed for all time the folly of protectionism. Over the past 200 years, not only has the argument against tariffs and trade barriers won nearly universal agreement among economists but it has also proven itself in the real world, where we have seen free-trading nations prosper while protectionist countries fall behind.
 
America's most recent experiment with protectionism was a disaster for the working men and women of this country. When Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley tariff in 1930, we were told that it would protect America from foreign competition and save jobs in this country -- the same line we hear today. The actual result was the Great Depression, the worst economic catastrophe in our history; one out of four Americans were thrown out of work. Two years later, when I cast my first ballot for President, I voted for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who opposed protectionism and called for the repeal of that disastrous tariff.
 
Ever since that time, the American people have stayed true to our heritage by rejecting the siren song of protectionism. In recent years, the trade deficit led some misguided politicians to call for protectionism, warning that otherwise we would lose jobs. But they were wrong again. In fact, the United States not only didn't lose jobs, we created more jobs than all the countries of Western Europe, Canada, and Japan combined. The record is clear that when America's total trade has increased, American jobs have also increased. And when our total trade has declined, so have the number of jobs.
 
Part of the difficulty in accepting the good news about trade is in our words. We too often talk about trade while using the vocabulary of war. In war, for one side to win, the other must lose. But commerce is not warfare. Trade is an economic alliance that benefits both countries. There are no losers, only winners. And trade helps strengthen the free world.
 
Yet today protectionism is being used by some American politicians as a cheap form of nationalism, a fig leaf for those unwilling to maintain America's military strength and who lack the resolve to stand up to real enemies -- countries that would use violence against us or our allies. Our peaceful trading partners are not our enemies; they are our allies. We should beware of the demagogs who are ready to declare a trade war against our friends -- weakening our economy, our national security, and the entire free world -- all while cynically waving the American flag. The expansion of the international economy is not a foreign invasion; it is an American triumph, one we worked hard to achieve, and something central to our vision of a peaceful and prosperous world of freedom.
 
After the Second World War, America led the way to dismantle trade barriers and create a world trading system that set the stage for decades of unparalleled economic growth. And in one week, when important multilateral trade talks are held in Montreal, we will be in the forefront of efforts to improve this system. We want to open more markets for our products, to see to it that all nations play by the rules, and to seek improvement in such areas as dispute resolution and agriculture. We also want to bring the benefits of free trade to new areas, including services, investment, and the protection of intellectual property. Our negotiators will be working hard for all of us.
 
Yes, back in 1776, our Founding Fathers believed that free trade was worth fighting for. And we can celebrate their victory because today trade is at the core of the alliance that secure the peace and guarantee our freedom; it is the source of our prosperity and the path to an even brighter future for America.
 
Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

Kishore Jayabalan explains the ideal of authentically free trade in contrast with the current protectionism of the Western nations.

""Free trade presents many challenges and opportunities to the poor. I would say that free trade, at a very short-term level, causes all kinds of disruptions. So, it looks like free trade can actually hurt the poor. But if you allow free trade and think about the economics behind free trade, what you're doing is you're allowing poor people the opportunity to engage in production and exchange with their richer neighbors. And not only are you creating an economic bond between the rich and the poor, through trade, you're creating a moral bond between the rich and the poor. We all know the experience of going to a market and getting to know a shop owner. Now, imagine if you could somehow expand that to, let's say, the city, or expand that within a country. Not only are you creating more economically-efficient systems, but you're creating a whole system of social interaction, where people feel much more involved in the lives of society and of each other.""

Well, kind of but not really!

The only country that comes close to the definition of a closed economy at this point (as you're about to find out in the video) is still not at 100% when it comes to autarky, with it engaging in some form of international trade... even if not on a huge scale.

Could other countries choose to embrace autarky?

In theory, sure. Practically speaking however, while some countries do decide to go with autarky-inspired policies when it comes to certain key industries... the economics are just not there when it comes to the closed economy equation as a whole.

Through this video, autarky as well as free trade have been defined, explained and compared. Through an easy-to-understand explanation as well as well-chosen examples, you'll understand why free trade is without a doubt the dominant force at this point, whereas autarky and closed economies are good topics for geopolitics classes... but that's pretty much it :)

President George W. Bush signed a free trade agreement with six Latin American countries on Tuesday, celebrating a victory in Congress so narrow and grueling that it cast doubt on the future of other trade-opening pacts the administration is negotiating.

Bush's signature at a ceremony in the East Room of the White House put the final touch on the Central American Free Trade Agreement.

The measure was approved by Congress last week with just a two-vote margin in the House after a bruising battle over the future of US trade policy.

That 217-215 vote handed the president an important political victory after months of intense lobbying by the president and his trade officials.

Speaking at the signing ceremony, Bush said ""CAFTA is more than a trade bill.""   

He said the measure would help strengthen fragile young democracies in Latin America and show those countries that the United States would stand by their side.

The agreement, with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, removes trade barriers and opens up the region to US goods and services. 

It also takes steps to facilitate investment in the area and strengthens protections for intellectual property.

The measure drew heavy Democratic opposition as well as some Republican defections. 

Critics argued that it would send more US jobs overseas, although Bush argued the opposite.

Bush said it would open more markets in the region to American goods.

He has also cast the measure as an important component of his second-term vow to spread democracy and freedom throughout the world to combat terrorism.

Joining Bush at the ceremony were congressional sponsors of the pact and committee leaders and diplomats from the countries that are signatories.

SCRIPT

Almost two million people according to local police gathered in Barcelona on Thursday to celebrate the Catalonian national day and to demand a referendum for the independence of Catalonia. 

Demonstrators marched through Diagonal Street and Gran Via, converging to form the letter ""V"" for ""vote"" and ""victory"". Protesters also waved pro-independence flags and shouted ""we want to vote"" and ""independence"". 

Many personalities addressed the crowds from three different stages along the march. Demonstrators explained that they did not feel Spanish and merely viewed Spain as a neighbour but not as part of their national and cultural identity.

Available from Amazon: http://amzn.to/2BNGHp4
Kindle Edition: http://amzn.to/2Ew5eA4

This very readable book is aimed at both ordinary concerned citizens and people with a bit of sophistication about economics. It is a systematic examination of why free trade is slowly bleeding America's economy to death and what can be done about it. It explains in detail why the standard economic arguments free traders use all the time are false, and what kind of economic ideas - well within the grasp of the average American - justify protectionism instead.

E.U. Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson gives a defense of free trade practices and globalization.

-----

Europe and the U.S.: Confronting Global Challenges with Peter Mandelson.

In a speech at the Carnegie Endowment, EU Commissioner of Trade Peter Mandelson argued that the European Union and the United States must use their collective economic weight to underwrite the openness of the global economy as its adjusts to the rise of new economic powers and greater global flows of investment. Mandelson said that the U.S. and the EU should use their own openness to ""underwrite a strong multilateral order based on cooperation and economic openness"" - Carnegie Endowment for International Peace

Peter Mandelson was born in Britain in 1953.

He studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at St Catherine's College, Oxford. As a young man he lived in Tanzania for a year, an experience which formed life-long impressions of Africa and the challenges of fighting poverty. A life-long pro-European, he led the British delegation to the first ever meeting of the European Communities Youth Forum in Strasbourg in 1979.

After working as an economist at the Trades Union Congress and as a current affairs TV producer, Peter Mandelson was later appointed Labour Party Director for Campaigns and Communications in 1985. Later he was Tony Blairs Campaign Manager in the May 1997 election that brought Labour to power in Britain.

In 1992 he was elected as member of parliament for the Northern English constituency of Hartlepool. He served until 2004 upon his appointment to the European Commission.

Peter Mandelson is honorary Chair of Policy Network, a European and international think tank whose journal and conferences promote the exchange and debate of centre-left policy ideas and European social democratic thinking. He was UK chairman of the UK-Japan 21st Century Group, which brings together leading academics, politicians and business people. He has traveled widely and has lectured throughout Europe, in Asia and the United States.",2d,6.0,PT5M51S,['http://fora.tv/2007/11/08/U_S__and_Europe_Confronting_Global_Challenges'],rzO_Fvok7Ns,27.0,rectangular,"['globalisation', 'european', 'union', 'economics', 'economy', 'markets', 'practices', 'business', 'tariffs', 'mandleson', 'jobs', 'workers', 'eu', 'us', 'foratv', 'fora.tv', 'fora', 'tv']",Peter Mandelson - In Defense of Free Trade,7522,"['IntelligenceSquared Debates', 'Long Now Foundation', 'The Atlantic', '92nd Street Y', 'IMF', 'WIRED', 'Commonwealth Club', 'The Economist', 'The New Yorker', 'Cannabis: Medical, Recreational and Legal', 'The New West with Will Hearst', 'The Aspen Institute', 'Asia Society', 'The Cato Institute', 'Politics and Prose', 'The Christian Science Monitor', 'Charles Koch Institute', 'Modern Marketing Summit', 'Maker Faire', 'bigideasfest', 'California Academy of Sciences', 'Dartmouth', 'Dwell', 'eg Conference', 'FertilityPlanit', 'The Frick Collection', 'Gamification Co', 'Gresham College', 'Georgetown University', 'HooverInstitution', 'Litquake', 'PolicyLink', 'Stanford', 'StartupProduct', 'Teen Vogue', 'Wonderfest Science', 'World Affairs']"
