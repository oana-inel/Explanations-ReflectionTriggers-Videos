Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

On October 1st Catalonia held a controversial referendum on independence. Before the vote took place, the Spanish Constitutional Courts ruled the vote illegal and sent the national guard to stop it from happening. Despite government opposition, the vote was held and clashes between voters and police ensued.

Ninety percent of the participants voted in favor of independence, but public surveys say that current support for independence in Catalonia is only 41 percent. 

Despite the contested referendum results, Catalonia has declared independence unilaterally. In response, Spain is moving to dissolve the Catalan regional government, remove its leaders from office and hold regional elections.

Hayek published an essay titled ""The Economic Conditions of Interstate Federalism."" Friedrich Hayek looked beyond the turmoil of the time to wonder what type of European community may bring peace and free trade down the line. Decades before the formation of the European Union, Hayek argued that regional protectionism would have to cease and that the need for a common foreign policy would likely lead to common economic policy. Then, a common monetary policy would evolve. With respect to economic policy, Hayek believed the most important point member nations would agree on would be free trade. Hayek expressed concern over a new form of protectionism in this system, namely that of administrative regulation on trade and commerce. Hayek's adherence to 19th century liberalism -- a system embracing free trade and limited government -- becomes clear toward the end of this essay.

It’s a new dawn for Africa as 44 leaders of AU member states have signed the Continental Free Trade Agreement which opens a 1.2 billion people market to each of the nations once ratified.  

But the two biggest economies, Nigeria and South Africa, however, did not sign up. It is still not clear why the two countries stayed on the sidelines. Others staying out of the continental trading bloc are Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Zambia, Burundi, Eritrea, Benin, Sierra Leone and Guinea Bissau. The project needed a minimum of 22 countries signing up to get off the ground, which was achieved.

SOT, Jordi Sanchez, President of the National Catalan Assembly (Spanish): ""I address all the Spanish citizens of good faith who maybe don't agree with Catalunya's independence, nor even with the right to self-determination, but are democrats. Thank you for the solidarity we received, and we ask you not to let the most basic democratic rights of the citizens of Catalunya be damaged in the name of your country. When power abuses its position, then it acts with no limits. Today it's Catalunya, but if you don't reject it, tomorrow they will come for your printers and media outlets in Madrid, Sevilla or Zaragoza.""

Find out how baby Jack’s mom and dad comfort him after a checkup where he was vaccinated, part of #HowVaccinesWork.

Baby Jack has some pain, redness and swelling where he got his shots. These are all common reactions that will soon go away. His mom uses a cool, wet cloth to help him feel better.

The doctor gave them some more tips for keeping Jack comfortable after his vaccines. The pediatrician recommended giving Jack lots of liquid, as Jack may eat less than usual for the first 24 hours after vaccination. 

Jack’s dad is reading over some information the doctor gave him, which explains other mild side effects Jack could experience over the next few days. 

Serious reactions to #vaccines are very rare. But, Jack’s parents will call his doctor if they notice anything that concerns them. 

Like all parents, Jack’s mom and dad become a little upset that he is uncomfortable after he gets his shots; but when they think about the risk of Jack becoming sick from any of the 14 vaccine-preventable #diseases, they know it’s worth it to protect him in the long run.

Learn more about childhood immunization by visiting https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/childhood-vaccines or talk with your child’s doctor.

1GHDHq7FSxg,2015-07-19T07:17:10.000Z,UCPvDn8vvYN6rk890faj8RMg,Dr.  Russell Blaylock Shares His Take on the Ongoing Vaccine Debate,"Malzberg Show - Dr. Blaylock shares his views on mandating vaccinations.  Vaccinations should not be mandated as they have never been proven to be 100% safe nor effective.  There is compelling scientific evidence showing that vaccinations are not as safe as the pharmaceutical industry-sponsored mainstream media are suggesting.  Significant serious complications such as death, seizures, encephalitis and brain damage can occur as a result of vaccination, all this is well documented in the medical literature and such complications are more frequent than the pharmaceutical industry-sponsored mainstream media would have people believe.

No one has the right to force parents to vaccinate especially when it is well documented in scientific studies demonstrating the mechanisms by which vaccinations can cause harm to children.

If it could be demonstrated that vaccinations were 100% safe and do not cause any adverse effects or harm, then it would be a different story. However, this cannot be demonstrated and the scientific evidence is clearly showing that vaccinations are continuing to cause complications..

Since the increase in the vaccination schedule, there appears to also be a correlation between the increase in auto-immune disease, neurological damage, impairment in learning, memory and speech linked to vaccination. 

The argument for mandating vaccination is that non-vaccinated children put other children at risk of disease  But if the vaccinations are as effective as the pharmaceutical companies suggest, why does it matter if other children are not vaccinated? If the vaccines are supposed  to prevent the child from getting the disease anyway? This is a poor argument, but it makes a lot of money for the pharmaceutical industries who sponsor the media and lobby politicians to support mandating their vaccinations. 

When the evidence for outbreaks like measles are examined we find that most of the children in these outbreaks were already fully vaccinated and that the vaccines are in fact no where near as effective as what the pharmaceutical companies are claiming. Many of these diseases such as measles and chicken pox are not fatal diseases in western countries, only in poor countries where there is lack of nutrition and the children there have compromised immune systems.",Russell Blaylock M.D,"Health (Industry)', 'Vaccine (Drug Class)', 'Russell Blaylock (Physician)', 'mandate'",PT5M53S,353,Vaccination,6

A new study of survey data finds that only a minority of parents choose not to immunize their children against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) due to concerns that vaccination would encourage or support youth sexual activity, a reason frequently cited by doctors as a barrier to advocating for this vaccine. Instead, the results show, parental concerns that steer young people away from vaccination tend to focus on safety worries, lack of necessity, knowledge about HPV and absence of physician recommendation, according to Johns Hopkins researchers who led the investigation.

The findings, published in the November issue of the Journal of Adolescent Health, could help public health officials and professional societies develop new interventions to increase rates of HPV vaccination.",Johns Hopkins Medicine,"Johns Hopkins Hospital', 'Johns Hopkins Medicine', 'Promise of Medicine', 'Baltimore (City/Town/Village)', 'Maryland (US State)', 'HPV', 'Adolescent Health', 'HPV Vaccination', 'hpv cure', 'human papillomavirus', 'hpv warts'",PT4M45S,285,Vaccination,5

Once the antigens enter the blood, they circulate along with other cells, such B and T cells. B and T cells are white blood cells that help the body defend itself against foreign invaders. As the antigens invade the body's tissues, they attract the attention of macrophages. Macrophages are non-specific scavengers, which in this case, engulf the antigens. The macrophages then signal the T cells that antigens are invading. The killer-type of T cells respond by attacking the invading antigen. Finally, the suppressor T cells stop the attack. After a vaccination, the body will have a memory of an encounter with a potentially dangerous invader for a period of time, and hopefully have a better ability to fight it off if ever exposed to it again in greater numbers. A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing micro-organism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and keep a record of it, so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these micro-organisms that it later encounters. Vaccines can be prophylactic (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or ""wild"" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g., vaccines against cancer are also being investigated). The administration of vaccines is called vaccination. The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified; for example, the influenza vaccine,  the HPV vaccine, and the chicken pox vaccine. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases;  widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that licensed vaccines are currently available to prevent or contribute to the prevention and control of twenty-five infections.

Vaccine Basics How Vaccines Work What is Immunity? When disease germs enter your body, they start to reproduce. Your immune system recognizes these germs as foreign invaders and responds by making proteins called antibodies. These antibodies’ first job is to help destroy the germs that are making you sick. They can’t act fast enough to prevent you from becoming sick, but by eliminating the attacking germs, antibodies help you to get well. The antibodies’ second job is to protect you from future infections. They remain in your bloodstream, and if the same germs ever try to infect you again — even after many years — they will come to your defense. Only now that they are experienced at fighting these particular germs, they can destroy them before they have a chance to make you sick. This is immunity. It is why most people get diseases like measles or chickenpox only once, even though they might be exposed many times during their lifetime. Vaccines to the Rescue. Vaccines offer a solution to this problem. They help you develop immunity without getting sick first.
Vaccines are made from the same germs (or parts of them) that cause disease; for example, polio vaccine is made from polio virus. But the germs in vaccines are either killed or weakened so they won’t make you sick. Vaccines containing these weakened or killed germs are introduced into your body, usually by injection. Your immune system reacts to the vaccine the same as it would if it were being invaded by the disease — by making antibodies. The antibodies destroy the vaccine germs just as they would the disease germs — like a training exercise. Then they stay in your body, giving you immunity. If you are ever exposed to the real disease, the antibodies are there to protect you.
Why are vaccinations important?
Vaccinations protect your child against serious diseases by stimulating the immune system to create antibodies against certain bacteria or viruses.
What diseases do vaccines protect against?
Immunizing your baby with vaccines protects against serious diseases like measles, whooping cough, polio, meningococcal disease, tetanus, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, chickenpox, influenza, and more.
I don’t know anybody who has had these diseases. Why does my baby need these vaccines?
While a few of these diseases have virtually disappeared because of vaccination, reported cases of people with diseases like measles and whooping cough have been on the increase lately. Even if some diseases do completely disappear in the U.S., they are common in other parts of the world and are just a plane ride away.",AniMed,"vaccine', 'vaccination', 'injection', 'antigen', 'body', 'human body', 'B cell', 'T cell', 'white blood cells', 'wbc', 'blood', 'immunity', 'immunology', 'macrophage', 'animation', 'video', 'body defence system', 'How Do Vaccines Work', 'how they work', 'vaccines explained', 'immune system', 'disease', 'microbe', 'toxins', 'pathogen', 'infectious diseases', 'infections', 'how vaccines work', 'vaccine documentary', 'vaccine mechanism', 'vaccination explained', 'how does vaccination work', 'vaccines truth', 'understanding vaccines', 'microbiology', 'lecture', 'medical'",PT1M27S,87,Vaccination,2

The border was up to now considered a mere curiosity, but the unrest over a recent independence referendum held by the Catalan regional government has changed that. 
The time-worn bell tower offers the only panorama of the dried-up Senia river that serves as a natural boundary between the Valencian region and Catalonia.
Although both communities pertain to parallel administrations, the town is mainly thought-of as one.
On Tuesday many employees in the wealthy northeastern Catalan region of Spain stopped work and massive street protests were held in Barcelona. There tens of thousands marched against what they consider repression of their civil rights by the Spanish government after it tried to stop the independence vote on Sunday.
Many concerned citizens remain on edge, with San Rafael residents especially worried about the possibility that the brewing conflict could literally split their community in two.
San Rafael shares with Catalonia irrigation, roads, electricity supply and even the phone telephone prefix. 
Another issue appears to be the diminishing political conversation, especially among the elderly.

Catalans shed tears of joy and rushed to embrace one another as the region's lawmakers announced the result. Footage also shows one supporter receiving treatment from paramedics after apparently losing consciousness. The medics later evacuated him.

The vote came just before the Spanish national Senate voted in favour of invoking Article 155. The measure was activated by Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Saturday, and would allow Madrid to establish de facto direct rule over Catalonia. Rajoy is now expected to hold a cabinet meeting to discuss possible next steps.

As a teacher of IB Economics in Santiago, Chile, these videos were created to help Standard Level students navigate their way through their two-year course of study.  I have made these videos public in the hope that they might be helpful to other economics students around the world.

It is important to note that I use Jocelyn Blink and Ian Dorton's ""IB Economics Course Companion"" as the primary text in class.  As a result, many of these videos use this text as source material.  I have found it to be an excellent resource for students.  Another source you may find helpful is Jason Welker’s site www.econclassroom.com.  Welker’s site and course companions are excellent and have served as another source for these videos.  Thank you Jocelyn, Ian, and Jason.

I hope you find these videos helpful to your study of IB Economics and please let me know if you have any suggestions to improve them.

When a good is imported with free trade, the consumer surplus increases (consumers benefit from cheaper prices) while the producer surplus decreases (domestic producers are hurt).  The gains to consumers are larger than the losses to producers, so importing increases the total surplus and makes the country better off.

FURTHER READING
“One of the most pressing choices facing modern economies is whether to adopt a policy of free trade or of protectionism, that is, whether to encourage foreign goods into the country with minimum tariffs and allow industries to relocate abroad; or whether to make it hard for foreign firms to sell their goods internally and discourage domestic producers tempted by cheaper wages in other lands…”

According to local police, 65-thousand people attended the annual public display of pomp and patriotism in Plaza Catalunya and along the Paseo de Gracia, one of the city's most iconic tourist avenues. 
Wearing Spanish flags on their shoulders, demonstrators chanted that they were both Spanish and Catalan.
Catalan leaders, who are demanding independence for the wealthy northeastern region stayed away from ceremonies in Barcelona - as usual.
Catalonia's mostly pro-independence parliament passed a motion on Thursday calling for the abolition of the monarchy.
Nearby, hundreds of Catalan independence supporters held a so-called ""anti-fascist"" demonstration. 
Police escorted them and made sure the two demonstrations didn't cross each other to avoid clashes.
Polls show Catalans are roughly equally divided on the issue over independence for the region.

Cate Parker’s son Thomas was diagnosed with Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), a disorder that impairs the immune system. People with CVID are highly susceptible to catching infection. Unless we all get vaccinated, we put people like Thomas at risk of becoming seriously ill from vaccine-preventable diseases.

What is FREE-TRADE ZONE? What does FREE-TRADE ZONE mean? FREE-TRADE ZONE meaning - FREE-TRADE ZONE definition - FREE-TRADE ZONE explanation.

Source: Wikipedia.org article, adapted under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ license.

A free-trade zone (FTZ) is a specific class of special economic zone. They are a geographic area where goods may be landed, handled, manufactured or reconfigured, and reexported without the intervention of the customs authorities. Only when the goods are moved to consumers within the country in which the zone is located do they become subject to the prevailing customs duties. Free-trade zones are organized around major seaports, international airports, and national frontiers—areas with many geographic advantages for trade. It is a region where a group of countries has agreed to reduce or eliminate trade barriers. Free-trade zones can also be defined as labor-intensive manufacturing centers that involve the import of raw materials or components and the export of factory products.

Free-trade zones are referred to as ""foreign-trade zones"" in the United States (Foreign Trade Zones Act of 1934). In the United States, FTZs provide Customs-related advantages as well as exemptions from state and local inventory taxes. In other countries, they are called ""special economic zones"" or ""free zones"" and were previously called ""free ports"" or ""export processing zones"". Free zones range from specific-purpose manufacturing facilities to areas where legal systems and economic regulation vary from the normal provisions of the country concerned. Free zones may reduce taxes, Customs duties, and regulatory requirements for registration of business. Zones around the world often provide special exemptions from normal immigration procedures and foreign investment restrictions as well as other features. Free zones are intended to foster economic activity and employment that could occur elsewhere. Farole, Akinci, ed., ""Special Economic Zones: Progress, Challenges and Future Directions, World Bank, 2011.

The world's first free-trade zone was established in Shannon, Ireland (Shannon Free Zone). This was an attempt by the Irish Government to promote employment within a rural area, make use of a small regional airport and generate revenue for the Irish economy. It was hugely successful, and is still in operation today. The number of worldwide free-trade zones proliferated in the late 20th century. In the United States free-trade zones were first authorized in 1934.

Corporations setting up in a zone may be given tax breaks as an incentive. Usually, these zones are set up in underdeveloped parts of the host country; the rationale is that the zones will attract employers and thus reduce poverty and unemployment, and stimulate the area's economy. These zones are often used by multinational corporations to set up factories to produce goods (such as clothing or shoes).

Free-trade zones in Latin America date back to the early decades of the 20th century. The first free-trade regulations in this region were enacted in Argentina and Uruguay in the 1920s. The Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA) was created in the 1960 Treaty of Montevideo by Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. However, the rapid development of free-trade zones across the region dates from the late 1960s and the early 1970s. Latin American Integration Association is a Latin American trade integration association, based in Montevideo.

Free-trade uones are also known as special economic zones in some countries. Special economic zones (SEZs) have been established in many countries as testing grounds for the implementation of liberal market economy principles. SEZs are viewed as instruments to enhance the acceptability and the credibility of the transformation policies and to attract domestic and foreign investment.

In 1999, there were 43 million people working in about 3000 FTZs spanning 116 countries producing clothes, shoes, sneakers, electronics, and toys. The basic objectives of EPZs are to enhance foreign exchange earnings, develop export-oriented industries and to generate employment opportunities.",The Audiopedia,"dictionary', 'english dictionary', 'online dictionary', 'vocabulary', 'english vocabulary', 'online vocabulary', 'how to pronounce words', 'what do words mean', 'free-trade zone', 'what is free-trade zone', 'free-trade zone meaning', 'free-trade zone definition', 'free-trade zone explanation', 'what is the meaning of free-trade zone', 'what is the definition of free-trade zone', 'what does free-trade zone mean', 'what does free-trade zone stand for'",PT4M54S,294,Free Trade,5

The Spanish government has called a snap election in the northwest Catalonia region for December 21.
The vote follows government leaders in Madrid imposing direct rule on the region, which is threatening to break away after a secession referendum.
But 10,000 people living in a remote valley high in the mountains between Catalonia and France do not feel affinity to Catalonia and have little time for the Catalan independence movement.

Rather than boring grammar lessons, we provide free interesting listening experiences for learners of Spanish. We believe that the best way to learn Spanish is to have authentic experiences with it. By listening to our stories, culture explanations and games, you will get used to real Spanish as it's used in context, and eventually develop a native-like intuition for the grammar and the vocabulary, together with a clear pronunciation.

The videos try to use basic Spanish as much as possible and be easy enough for a complete beginner in the language to get the gist of the story and start picking up vocabulary. That way you'll get that i+1 necessary to make fast progress in the language.

Taking advantage of preferential programs can also create risk of non-compliance due to the complexity of trade rules.
 
This risk or lack of manpower to utilize such programs can be overcome by leveraging technology.

Amber Road’s global trade management software automates the process in 4 steps:

1. Trade agreement identification:
Identification of preferential programs within your global trade lanes and projected cost savings.

2. Supplier solicitation campaigns:
Automated collection of product information from suppliers for rules of origin qualification.

3. Bill of material qualification:
Compilation of supplier’s information in a Bill of Materials certificate to generate the correct customs documentation.

4. Certificate management:
Managing certificates for origin updates, renewals and audits.

Anyone who has had chickenpox can develop shingles because VZV remains in the nerve cells of the body after the chickenpox infection clears and VZV can reappear years later causing shingles. Shingles most commonly occurs in people 50 years old or older, people who have medical conditions that keep the immune system from working properly, or people who receive immunosuppressive drugs.

6WQtRI7A064,2010-02-28T18:55:21.000Z,UCBff-vKbn8dU2Pb-_vFkiRg,Bill Gates Admits Vaccines Are Used for Human Depopulation,"Next are two short excerpts from a recently filmed TED presentation (Feb 2010) by none other than Bill ""Microsoft"" Gates.

At the heart of Gates' address lies the central Global Warming dogma, which dictates that Co2 emitted by human beings are the primary culprit for the unwanted heating of the globe. Since this artificial alleged human-induced heating effect allegedly stands to devastate the planet if left unabated, Global Warming dogma proponents therefore argue that human Co2 emissions must be drastically reduced. As Gates casually addresses the issue, he goes on to state that one way to accomplish this goal is to reduce the global human population. 

ERRATUM: To be completely fair and accurate, I should have stated that Gates seeks to reduce the anticipated growth of the human population rather than that he seeks to reduce the current population. I admit that the latter slogan, that is contained in the video, is a bit misleading and I do not want to insinuate that Gates seeks to kill off currently living people. He rather seeks to lower the projected population growth.

He postulates the central equation, giving an estimation of the humanly emitted C02 load per year, to be:

Co2 = P times S times E times C

Where P stands for the population number, S the average number of services per person, E the average amount of energy units per service, and C the average Co2 emitted load per unit of service, per year; Co2 stands for the projected total humanly emitted carbon-dioxide load by the entire population per year.

In the first clip you will hear him state in plain language that he considers VACCINES to be desirable to bring down the future population number P and so reduce Co2. You will also casually hear him promoting HEALTH CARE and REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES, to accomplish that same C02 reducing goal.

Here are Bill Gates' verbatim words [square parentheses additions for clarification purposes are mine though]:
""The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's heading up to about nine billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that [number of 9 billion] by perhaps 10 or 15 percent. But there we see an increase of about 1.3 [billion].""

Let's focus on the vaccines. Gates is stating that  he considers vaccines to be useful in contributing to bring the projected population growth of 2.2 billion down to 1.3 billion, roughly one billion. What kind of properties can thus reasonably be deduced that vaccines are to have according to Gates? Well, basically all the properties that impede people to either have children, or successfully rear them. In other words, Gates implicitly advocates the definition of his favorite kind of vaccine to be one that fosters infertility, sterility and (early onset) senility (autism) alike. Note that Gates does not mention a word on the much touted purported intention of vaccines: to offer protection against relevant diseases and therefore as such, precisely prolong life. Given the abundance of toxins in vaccines (see my blog for some links of simply Google ""toxin ingredient vaccine""), the position that vaccines contribute to decrease mortality rates, is kind of hard to maintain.

So Gates proves to be quite the humanitarian there huh? 

In the second excerpt you hear Gates explain what he considers to be the single most important thing that he would choose to see become a reality in the future time span of 50 years. He again confirms his ""love"" for the vaccine.

The court said such a move would be ""a breach of the constitution"".
Earlier Prime Minister Mario Rajoy warned Catalonia's regional government against declaring independence after a disputed vote last Sunday.
Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont had indicated that he could make such a declaration at next week's session.
The court's ruling on Thursday upheld a challenge by Catalonia's Socialist Party, which opposes secession from Spain, and not from the government in Madrid.
Allowing the regional parliament to meet and declare independence, the court said, would violate the rights of the party's MPs.
An earlier ruling by the court aimed at stopping Sunday's vote was ignored by Catalonia's leaders. That challenge to the court had come from Spain's government, which condemned the referendum as illegal.

The trade deal, which has been fifteen years in the making, was signed during Poroshenko's 30-hour visit to Israel. It is expected to boost trade between the two countries to over US$1 billion [€880 billion] annually within five years.

""This is a historic day in the relations between Israel and Ukraine and a historic day because of the absolute removal all the barriers in our economic ties. And I want to congratulate you and thank you for this effective co-operation,"" Poroshenko said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also spoke on the issue of missile strike targeting Iranian positions in Damascus early on Monday morning, after an Iranian missile was fired from Syrian territory.

""Israel will continue to block Iran's efforts to use Syria, Lebanon and Gaza as forward bases for attacking Israel for the express purpose which they openly declare - destroying Israel. No country should stand aside while its destruction is being planned or advanced and Israel exercises its basic right of self-defence and pre-emptive self-defence,"" he said.

Protectionism, on the other hand, is a system of trade that discriminates against foreign goods and services in an attempt to favor domestic goods and services. In theory, free trade outperforms protectionism by bringing lower cost goods and services to consumers. In practice, the benefits of free trade can be seen in countries like America and Hong Kong. Both countries have a relatively high degree of free trade, and, as a consequence, have experienced an explosion of wealth.

Wouldn't Vaccinate His Son,"http://www.StopMandatoryVaccination.com - “If you believe what you are told by the AMA and the CDC and your doctor, you’re not doing enough research.” In 1991 Scott Cooper and his wife researched vaccine safety and efficacy, determined vaccines are NOT safe or effective, and refused to vaccinate their son. Interestingly, their son was much healthier than his vaccinated peers throughout childhood. At the time, Scott worked as a sales rep for Merck & Co., a large vaccine manufacturer, and he had dived deep into researching vaccines and the risk associated with vaccination. His Pediatrician was befuddled that Scott would not vaccinate, especially because he worked for a large vaccine manufacturer! His son continues to be healthy, and Scott and his wife have no regrets about not vaccinating their son.

It is important to note that I use Jocelyn Blink and Ian Dorton's ""IB Economics Course Companion"" as the primary text in class.  As a result, many of these videos use this text as source material.  I have found it to be an excellent resource for students.  Another source you may find helpful is Jason Welker’s site www.econclassroom.com.  Welker’s site and course companions are excellent and have served as another source for these videos.  Thank you Jocelyn, Ian, and Jason.

I hope you find these videos helpful to your study of IB Economics and please let me know if you have any suggestions to improve them.  

Enjoy!

RESTRICTIONS: NONE

On October 1, 2017, Catalonia voted for independence, despite opposition from the central Spanish government.

The northeast region of Catalonia is one of Spain's 17 autonomous communities. It's home to 7.5 million people, and has its own distinct language, history, and culture, according to the bBC.

Catalonia was once under the kingdom of Aragon, which unified with Castile in the 15th century. It remained a state until it was defeated in the 1714 Siege of Barcelona, and its sovereignty was abolished. Under the newly centralized Spanish realm, Catalans were forced to adopt the Castilian language and customs.

The region regained autonomy when Spain became a republic in 1931, but lost it again during the Franco dictatorship. Franco's death restored democracy, allowing Catalonia to have its own Parliament, police force, and education system.

Though they have a high degree of autonomy, Catalans are not satisfied with the central government.

As Spain's wealthiest region, it generates 20% of the national GDP. But high budget cuts during the 2008 financial crisis, and complaints of paying more taxes than they get back have increased separatist sentiment.

The Brookings Institute reports that in 2010, the Spanish Constitutional Court reversed a 2006 ruling that granted the region 'nation' status and its own tax system, angering many and fueling the movement for independence.

This movement culminated in the October 1 referendum, which Madrid has called illegal.

A Catalonian secession would impact the Spanish economy, but also see the region out of the EU. With no free trade, the region's economy could shrink, and the unemployment rate could double.

But do all Catalans want independence? Polls taken before the referendum showed that while 70% wanted the right to vote, only 41% sought independence.

Still, Madrid's response was aggressive. It arrested Catalan leaders, and took down websites and apps in an effort to thwart the vote.

On the day of the referendum, violence erupted as police seized ballots, and forcibly stopped people from voting. Despite the danger, voter turnout was at 42.3%, with nearly 90% of those who voted backing secession.

Catalan's president has said he will declare independence within 48 hours if the 'yes' side won. If this happens, Spain will enter a constitutional crisis and may be forced to suspend Catalonia's autonomy.

Available from Amazon: http://amzn.to/2BNGHp4
Kindle Edition: http://amzn.to/2Ew5eA4

This very readable book is aimed at both ordinary concerned citizens and people with a bit of sophistication about economics. It is a systematic examination of why free trade is slowly bleeding America's economy to death and what can be done about it. It explains in detail why the standard economic arguments free traders use all the time are false, and what kind of economic ideas - well within the grasp of the average American - justify protectionism instead.

Well, I have an answer that may not surprise you: It's complicated. This week, Jacob and Adriene will argue that globalization is, in aggregate, good. Free trade and globalization tend to provide an overall benefit, and raises average incomes across the globe. The downside is that it isn't good for every individual in the system. In some countries, manufacturing jobs move to places where labor costs are lower. And some countries that receive the influx of jobs aren't prepared to deal with it, from a regulatory standpoint. Anyway, Jacob and Adriene can explain the whole thing to you in 10 minutes.

However, these agreements continue to be referred to and legitimized (or critiqued) as “free trade agreements.” Consequently, the economic effects of the stronger IP rights — which are actually a form of protectionism — in these agreements, tend to be glossed over.

In this video, Blayne Haggart argues that referring to the TPP and similar next-generation trade agreements improperly as free trade agreements can lead policy makers to ignore the ways in which the world has changed and to underplay the long-term importance of parts of the agreement — in particular, those related to IP — that do not fall neatly into the free trade world view.",Centre for International Governance Innovation,"trade', 'intellectual property', 'NAFTA', 'TPP', 'CIGI', 'Blayne Haggart', 'innovation', 'Canada'",PT3M16S,196,Free Trade,4

Hollywood TV is your source for daily celebrity news and gossip!
Jessica Biel is speaking out after she received backlash for her meetings with anti-vaccination advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. I am not against vaccinations,"" Biel wrote on Instagram Thursday. ""I support children getting vaccinations and I also support families having the right to make educated medical decisions for their children alongside their physicians."" Biel explained her concerns with SB 276, a California bill that seeks to limit medical exemptions for vaccinations. “My dearest friends have a child with a medical condition that warrants an exemption from vaccinations, and should this bill pass, it would greatly affect their family's ability to care for their child in this state,"" Biel's post continued. 

Daniel Radcliffe has joined the cast of The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt interactive special coming to Netflix in 2020. Little is known about the part the Harry Potter star will play, but the special sees Kimmy set off on her biggest adventure yet, taking her to three different states.

Cuba Gooding Jr. surrendered to the NYPD for questioning on Thursday. The Oscar winner was charged with forcible touching, a misdemeanor, relating to an alleged groping incident last weekend. His attorney Mark Heller said at a press conference , ""Mr. Gooding has not acted inappropriately in any shape or form.” He added “I, frankly, am shocked and horrified that this case is being prosecuted.""

BOnEpgNa0Kk,2015-01-15T21:16:40.000Z,UCeu5Fifjk24zkuyRmXHTcTg,Vaccines 2.0: The Careful Parent's Guide to Making Safe Vaccination Choices for Your Family,"Not only have we taken the CDC’s childhood vaccine schedule apart, perhaps in more ways than one, our book will also help you put it together to fit your family’s needs. Making the right choices about vaccinating your children is not an easy one and involves both individual choices and an overall plan: what are your own beliefs about what is best for your child? What are the local rules and mandates in your state that you will face? How do you want to work with your pediatrician or other health service providers? How do you want to work with day care services and the school system? Ultimately, what is the overall vaccination schedule you want to choose for your child?

Some of our friends are against vaccination on principle; we are not, but we respect their position. Like them, we support choice as the bedrock of health freedom; but that choice includes the freedom to vaccinate, and a lot of parents are going to choose to vaccinate. They should not be left without unbiased information on how to provide vaccines they choose to give their own children.

So the first thing to understand is this truly is your choice – not ours (we’re not recommending any specific schedule here), not any one doctor’s, and certainly not the government’s. This is America, after all, the land of the free and the home of the brave – which you’ll need to be as you think and act for yourselves about this fraught topic. It’s impossible to avoid hearing dire talk about “requirements,” about ”firing” parents from medical practices or expelling kids from school if they don’t follow the letter of the federal vaccine chart.

But as citizens, we still hold the keys to choices affecting our offspring, and we do not hand them over to anybody in return for the right to a public education or any other inducement. The starting point for the discussion is freedom of speech and freedom of choice, and the fact that parents are in charge when it comes to decisions involving their children as long as those decisions don’t hinder their health or wellbeing. Given the well-founded concerns we’ve demonstrated about individual vaccines – as well as the bloated childhood immunization schedule -- making careful vaccination choices hardly counts as jeopardizing kids’ health. In fact, the real threat is not stepping out of line but mindlessly toeing it, at least when your child’s wellbeing is on the line.

She learned what vaccines are, what vaccines are made of, the supposed reason for vaccination, and then the type of harm each vaccine can do to human life. She wept and cried as she read story after story from parents who have vaccine injured children. She refused the Vitamin K shot and was berated by the doctor and she refused the vaccine anyway. She figured out that the doctor just wanted her to live in fear. She then read more books and talked with more people about vaccines and vaccination and concluded that we don’t need vaccines or vaccination to have a healthy child. She also learned that children are being drugged by pharmaceutical drugs, which is not in harmony with natural living. She believes in natural living and natural health and natural immunity by keeping the body healthy through organic food, supplements and other natural methods of treatment, such as through Homeopathy. Her child is four years old and vaccine free and healthy.

Well, kind of but not really!

The only country that comes close to the definition of a closed economy at this point (as you're about to find out in the video) is still not at 100% when it comes to autarky, with it engaging in some form of international trade... even if not on a huge scale.

Could other countries choose to embrace autarky?

In theory, sure. Practically speaking however, while some countries do decide to go with autarky-inspired policies when it comes to certain key industries... the economics are just not there when it comes to the closed economy equation as a whole.

Through this video, autarky as well as free trade have been defined, explained and compared. Through an easy-to-understand explanation as well as well-chosen examples, you'll understand why free trade is without a doubt the dominant force at this point, whereas autarky and closed economies are good topics for geopolitics classes... but that's pretty much it :)

SCRIPT

Thousands of Spanish union protesters marched through central Barcelona on Sunday to oppose Catalan independence and the referendum on November 9. 

Demonstrators waved Spanish and Catalan flags and held banners with slogans against former Catalan President Jordi Pujol, as they chanted slogans like ""They can't lie to us, Catalonia is Spain"" and ""I am Spanish."" The rally was called by Moviment Civic and Plataforma per Catalunya.

The protest coincided with the National Day of Hispanicity.

Sharif's on Vimeo: http://vimeo.com/user14513847
""I'm Sharif, a New Yorker, and this last September I went to Europe. In Barcelona I accidentally joined a huge demonstration. 1.5 million people took to the streets demanding independence of Catalonia from Spain. Then I realized that funny enough the city that most people relate to Spain doesn't want to be Spanish at all"".

En Sharif és un jove novaiorquès que era de viatge a Barcelona l'Onze de Setembre passat. I es va trobar enmig de la gran manifestació per la independència. Va quedar tan impressionat que després va voler saber més coses sobre el fet català. Avui ha publicat un vídeo en què ho explica, amb subtítols en català, i anuncia que cada dimarts publicarà un vídeo 'sobre la lluita catalana per la independència'. I diu: 'M'agradaria, bona gent d'internet, que m'ajudeu a fer-ho arribar a més gent'.

En el vídeo, Sharif explica que l'Onze de Setembre la gent sortia de tot arreu, de les cases, de les botigues... que mai a la seva vida no havia vist una manifestació tan gran com aquella. Es confessa impressionat pel caire pacífic de la manifestació, i pel fet que hi havia gent de totes les edats. Després va saber que hi havien assistit un milió i mig de manifestants, 'com tot Manhattan', i, més endavant, que s'havien convocat unes eleccions per al 25 de novembre en què Catalunya s'hi juga el futur com a país independent. També va aprendre més coses sobre Catalunya, sobre la seva cultura i història, i ara està disposat a parlar del camí cap a la independència cada dimarts amb un vídeo.",Catalan Process,,PT6M4S,364,Catalonia Independence,7

Healing the child from the vaccine injury required years and years of alternative medicine (natural medicine) treatment. His other child also suffered from vaccines and because of these vaccine reactions, he decided not to vaccinate his children. Interestingly, he moved to California five years ago to ensure he could secure a personal belief exemption to vaccination because where he had lived - New Jersey - he could not get a personal belief exemption or religious exemption from vaccination in order to attend school. However, currently in California a bill has been introduced which would eliminate personal belief exemptions: it is called SB 277. You can imagine his pain.

His doctors wouldn’t help him understand the vaccine damage that occurred, which is why he turned to natural medicine doctors for help, and natural medicine ultimately helped recover his son. He determined that vaccines are NOT safe, and stopped vaccinating his children. He believes that vaccines have toxins that would harm his children. He is also not worried about childhood diseases because his children are in good health and therefore they will be able to recover from a childhood illness. He recommends that parents research diseases and the history of childhood diseases to understand why vaccines are neither safe nor effective: http://www.stopmandatoryvaccination.com/public-health/

The protesters chanted ""Long Live Spain"" in front of police and press reporters. A retired member of the Spanish Armed Forces, Ignacio said that the Catalan government had ""conditioned thinking in society"" in favour of independence.

He went on to question the independence movement's links to corruption in the past and its future viability as an independent state, saying, ""Explain to me who is going to give a new country €30 billion which in theory would be born bankrupt, outside of the European Union, with all those companies that will also go bankrupt. Who can lend them money? Unless, they already have it.""

Hundreds of supporters of Catalan independence gathered in the central Placa del Vi square in Girona, in front of the city hall, to follow the vote of the Catalan parliament and to call for the release of imprisoned activists Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez. Numerous pro-Catalan independence flags (known as ‘Estreladas’) dotted the square and the crowd erupted in celebrations once the voting results came in.

Despite fears half-a-dozen Eurosceptics led by Boris Johnson could quit, Mrs May said ministers had signed off a package that will see the UK sign up to EU rules on goods - potentially hampering prospects for a trade deal with the US. She said the model thrashed out during the marathon away-day would allow Britain to 'avoid friction' that could harm business while preventing a hard Irish border. But amid signs the EU will immediately reject the ideas, the Cabinet also agreed to step up planning for 'no deal'. ‘Today in detailed discussions the Cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU,' Mrs May said. ‘Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve.'

Activists and supporters gathered in the centre of the Catalan capital, just eleven days before the trial against the Catalan separatists is set to begin.

Volunteers carried Catalonia flags and banners, while a number of them were seen climbing a ladder up to the balcony of the European Union Commission offices, where they hanged a banner reading 'Self-determination is a right, not a crime'.

President of the Catalan National Assembly Elizenda Paluzie said: ""A group of members of the Catalan national assembly, have entered the headquarters of the representation of the European Union here in Catalonia, and have delivered a letter to Jean-Claude Junker and Ferran Tarradellas, who is the head of the representation of the European Union here in Barcelona, in which we denounce all the violations of fundamental rights that have occurred since the first fragrant violation, namely the police violence during the referendum on the first of October.""

Spain's prosecutor is seeking prison terms of up to 25 years for 12 Catalan politicians on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds, after the failed attempt at breaking away from Spain in 2017.

The “world’s fastest man” lends his image and voice to support this year’s Vaccination Week in the Americas
 Jamaican track superstar Usain Bolt has joined the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) in a campaign to raise awareness of the importance of vaccination in protecting health and preventing disease.
 The six-time Olympic gold medalist and 11-time world champion sprinter appears on posters and in a public service announcement (PSA) encouraging people to get vaccinated.
 The PSA and posters are part of PAHO’s 14th annual Vaccination Week in the Americas campaign, which highlights the life-saving benefits of vaccines. Countries throughout the Americas celebrate Vaccination Week each year with activities focused on reaching populations who lack regular access to health services.
 “Being the best athlete I can means staying healthy – including keeping up to date on my vaccines,” Bolt says in a social media post for the campaign. In the PSA, he says “I’m up to date on my vaccines. Are you?” and urges viewers to “Go for the gold” and get vaccinated.
 “Go for the gold – Get vaccinated!” is the campaign slogan for this year’s Vaccination Week in the Americas, which takes place from April 23 to 30. It references the upcoming 2016 summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, in which Bolt is scheduled to compete.
 “Vaccination is one of the most effective means we have to protect the health of children as well as adults,” said PAHO Director Carissa F. Etienne. “Having a world-class champion like Mr. Bolt supporting our campaign will help us reach more people with information on the benefits of vaccination – and for that, we are enormously grateful.”",PAHO TV,,PT31S,31,Vaccination,1

Tell us what you think in the comment section below. Join TYT: https://goo.gl/v8E64M

""Catalonia declared itself an independent republic on Friday. But nobody is sure how long it will last.
Within hours of Catalonia’s emotional vote, Spain’s prime minister announced he would dismantle the Catalan government, suspend its ministers, dissolve its upstart parliament, take over the regional police and call home any Catalan diplomats abroad.
The orders were effective immediately. In a Europe where change once took place at a glacial pace, this was the latest surprise in a continent rocked by division and upset, populism and nationalism.
But how the central government will enforce its orders is the question everyone is asking. Will the National Police carry out the new orders? Or will the separatist leaders in Barcelona step aside to fight another day?”*

SCRIPT

Maria Lapiedra, a pornstar from Catalonia, was in Barcelona on Monday to film a video for her song ""Votarem"" ('we will vote'). The song is part of her personal campaign to increase the profile of the independence movement of Catalonia. 

Draped in the Catalan flag, the pornstar, who believes that her beauty can help achieve independence for the region, was driven around the city centre on a scooter whilst shooting her video. She also posed in front of Guadi's Sagrada Familia in her bra and interacted with local people and commuters in an attempt to inspire people to vote for independence, should a referendum be held. 

Her quirky campaign may be in vain however, since on Tuesday Spain's constitutional court barred the government of Catalonia from holding a symbolic vote on independence on Sunday, November 9.

He has devoted the past 30 years to educating parents and health practitioners about vaccines, encouraging informed consent and non-mandatory laws. He is the author of several articles, studies, and books on vaccines, including Miller’s Review of Critical Vaccine Studies(www.vacbook.com), Vaccine Safety Manual for Concerned Families and Health Practitioners(updated 2nd edition), and Vaccines, Are They Really Safe and Effective? Past organizations that he has lectured for include the International Chiropractic Pediatric Association, the International College of Integrative Medicine, the Hahnemann Academy of North America, and the Culture of Life Institute. Mr. Miller has a degree in psychology and is a member of Mensa.

 

Mr. Miller began his crusade against mandatory vaccines when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Very little data could be found on this topic. His search for the truth led him to scientific journals where numerous studies warned that vaccines are often unsafe and ineffective. His shock and anger at the suppression of this information culminated in his passionate defense of parents seeking to make truly informed vaccine decisions while retaining the right to accept or reject them.

Bill Gates recently went on record at a TED conference declaring that his foundation's vaccine programs' goals were to reduce the poulation. This has led a lot of people to jump to the conclusion that he was saying his vaccines affect fertility. However, if you look at previous interviews on teh subject, you will see that it's not tat simple and that there is a lot of twisted logic involved. Bottom line: Gates is an admitted depopulationist. Would you trust his intentions when it comes to people's health?
Prison Planet article on Gates, vaccines and depopulation with TED video embedded
""The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's heading up to about nine billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent!"" [About 1 Billion People!]- Bill Gates

70 representatives voted in favour, with ten against and two abstinences, with another handful of senators boycotting the vote altogether and leaving Spanish flags on their pews.

Catalan President Carles Puigdemont cast the final of the 82 votes before the Speaker Carme Forcadell set about counting the result.

She declared to a standing ovation from the parliament before some members started singing the Catalan national anthem and shouting 'Visca la Republica Catalana' ('Long live the Catalan Republic').

It follows the Spanish central government’s plans to invoke Article 155 which would impose direct rule by Madrid over Catalonia.

Be Sweet to Babies
Research shows - for infants less than 12 months of age:
1. Breastfeeding before, during and after the injection reduces pain in babies. For best effect, begin breastfeeding 2-5 minutes before the needle.
If your baby requires a further injection in the other leg, position your baby on the other breast. Ensure your baby has latched and is sucking well before the next needle is given.

2. If you are not breastfeeding, giving small amounts of sugar water before and during pokes reduces pain in babies. 

Remember -- Be Sweet to Babies during vaccinations
Ask your nurses or doctors about breastfeeding during vaccinations or other needles as well as other ways we can help babies during painful procedures.

SOT, Jose Maria, Barcelona citizen (Spanish): ""A shame, we can agree or disagree, some with the Government and other with the Generalitat, but the right to vote is democracy, and what we lived yesterday is awful, that is not democracy or anything, it is violence. Seeing how innocent people were voting peacefully and how the state police took action without mercy, without any compromise with the people... a shame""

C/U Newspaper

C/U Newspaper headline reading (Spanish): ""Intolerable repression""


SOT, Sergio Burgos, Barcelona citizen (Spanish): ""A shame, a shame. Honestly, if there was anyone doubting whether being independent or not being independent, apart from agreeing or not with the referendum... I think I am pretty sure right now. I am one of those people who supported the referendum, but I was not sure if I was independent or not. But after seeing the actions of the national police, while we have our own police that obeyed their orders peacefully, and seeing how the police of the Spanish state acted… I know, I repudiate all the actions that took place. It was a shame, a shame""

SOT, Sergio Burgos, Barcelona citizen (Spanish): ""The central government and the Catalan government have not reached an agreement because of their own fault. And if they didn’t reach an agreement, I think it’s because they are not suitable for the position they are in.""


SOT, Miriam, Barcelona citizen (Spanish): ""I think it is a shame, I think that what the police did was exaggerated, I think that it was a really bad management of Rajoy’s government, because they have always said 'no' to Catalans, and well, this opened a big breach that it will be very difficult to sew.”

Rwandan President Paul Kagame said while opening the Africa CEO Forum at the Kigali Convention Center in Rwanda that 21 countries had ratified the Continental Free Trade Area.

Ethiopia last week took the agreement through Parliament, becoming the 21st country to do so.

For the trade deal that would create a market of $3 trillion and a market of 1.2 billion people with no tariff and border restrictions to be enforceable, 22 countries are required to ratify. The deal was negotiated over two years before being signed in Kigali last year.

Think about it in British terms; Imagine if when the Scots had their own independence referendum, imagine what would have happened if London had sent troops in the polling stations to beat up voters.

The result would not have been “yes” to the Union, it would have been a 90% majority in favour of Scotland leaving.

The heavy-handedness, the Francoist elements of the behaviour by Madrid, is pushing Catalonia out of Spain.""

Watch this week's video for a straight-forward run-down of the events surrounding the Catalonian independence vote in October 2017. 
I briefly cover off:
- What the relationship is between Catalonia and Spain
- A few reasons which might help to explain why many Catalans want independence
- What happened with the Catalonian Independence Referendum
- The aftermath of the Referendum
- How it differs in comparison to the Scottish Referendum in 2014

I hope it helps!

She never vaccinated her 4 year-old daughter, who shines with vibrant health. A few things she discovered during her massive research process: 
• The risk of vaccines are higher than the chances of her daughter getting Whooping Cough
• Polio is not a threat to our society, except from vaccination
• Vaccine makers cannot be sued for injury or death
• Vaccines have toxic ingredients
• Vaccines have Thimerosal in them, a dangerous mercury “preservative”
• Thimerosal increased in utero once flu shots started to be pushed onto pregnant women
• Injection is different than ingestion: for example, you can drink snake venom and not die, but get bit by a snake, and that can kill you
• Over 3 billion dollars has been paid out for vaccine related injury and vaccine related death
• Vaccines are not safe
• Why is our infant mortality rate so high and also the highest vaccination rate? Could it be the vaccines?
• Every parent deserves to know the full Truth about the dangers of vaccination before vaccinating their child. Learn more here:

Delivering his annual 'State of the Union' speech in the US Congress on Tuesday, Obama supported a bilateral agreement that would encompass half the world's economic output.

""Tonight I am announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union because trade that is free and fair across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs."" said US President Barak Obama.

The United States and the European Union already have the largest economic relationship in the world, worth over 2 billion euros per day.

But facing increased competition from emerging economies, both allies have been exploring ways to deepen their relations. 

""A future deal between the world's two most important economic powers will be a game-changer, giving a strong boost to our economies on both sides of the Atlantic."" 
""For these negotiations to succeed, we need -- above all -- political will: a desire to make our rules and regulations compatible, and to cut tariffs whenever it makes sense and is possible.""
""The Commission will move quickly to present a negotiating mandate to our Member States so we can start negotiations as soon as possible, still during the Irish Presidency of the Council."",  said EC's president Jose Manuel Barroso.

The European Commission said on Wednesday that they aim to complete negotiations by 2015. 

""Ideally, we'd like to complete this work in about two years from now -- but, more paramount than speed is achieving an ambitious deal.""

""Our main focus has to be to tackle those barriers which are behind the customs border -- such as differences in technical regulations, standards and certifications. These often cost time and money. This is where we can make real savings for our businesses and bring better value for consumers."", said EU commissioner for Trade Karel de Gucht. 

The EU executive estimates that a deeper trade deal with the US could generate €275 billion per year and create 2 million new jobs.",EURACTIV,"EU', 'Barak Obama', 'European Commission', 'Debate', 'US-EU trade', 'Policy', 'EU Affairs', 'United Stated', 'Euro', 'Europe', 'News', 'US', 'Report', 'Free Trade agreement', 'Politics', 'European Union', 'State of the Union', 'Jose Mnauel Barroso', 'EurActiv'",PT1M42S,102,Free Trade,2

---------------------------

Summary:
--------------
Catalonia is a nation within Spain with its own language and culture. For many years, Catalonia has been submitted to several oppressive laws that looked for Spain's homogeneity by settling a single language and centralizing power, and trying to extinct any other identity different from the Spanish one. In 1978, after fascist Franco's dictatorship, Catalonia gained a certain level of auto-government but today Spain is limiting our capacity to further administrate our justice, economy and language issues.
 
Independentism in Catalonia has been growing during the last 30 years, and many Spaniards think that Catalonia's independence is a silly thing. They argue that Catalan nationalism is a bad thing, but they never talk about Spanish nationalism, which, for them, is the only one that is good. Furthermore, being independentist does not necessarily mean being nationalist! I like being independent from other people, but that does not mean I am better than them!

Catalan independentism does not mean hating Spain: it simply looks for a better status for Catalonia, which is as legitimate as for France, Germany, Spain or any other country.

This video debates some of the arguments given against Catalonia's viability as an independent nation, and it is based on an article from Xavier Sala-i-Martin, a Catalan-American professor of economics at Columbia University.

By the time a vaccine comes to market, there has been decades of work to make sure the vaccine is effective and safe. Life-saving vaccines include the MMR, for measles, mumps and rubella. A very small and inaccurate study claimed the MMR vaccine caused autism but has been completely discredited. The study’s researchers even retracted their claims. The benefits of vaccination outweigh the minor side effects.

A speaker at the protest referred to separatist groups as ""clear allies of the Islamic invasion that we are suffering today"".

As well as burning flags, many of the protesters made the Nazi/fascist salute, an action which is deemed illegal in other European countries such as Germany, Austria and Slovakia. It is not considered a criminal offence in Spain and has ties to the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, an ally of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy.

H8Ot-x4ZWq0,2010-04-09T11:24:41.000Z,UC0uVZd8N7FfIZnPu0y7o95A,Obama and Free Trade: Q&A With Jagdish Bhagwati,"Free trade is never more necessary - or vulnerable - than in times of economic distress. The current global downturn is no exception. Protectionist barriers have shot up all over the world, including the United States.

Last year, Congress killed a pilot program allowing Mexican trucks to transport goods across America and included Buy America provisions in the stimulus bill banning foreign steel and iron from infrastructure projects funded by the legislation. 

More disturbingly, President Barack Obama, after chiding Congress for flirting with protectionism, initiated his own ill-advised affair by imposing a 35 percent tariff on cheap Chinese tires. 

If the world manages to avoid an all-out trade war of the kind that helped trigger the Great Depression after the U.S. imposed the Smoot-Hawley tariffs in 1930, it will be in no small part due to the efforts of one man: Jagdish N. Bhagwati, an ebullient and irreverent 76-year-old professor of economics at Columbia University. 

Bhagwati has done more than perhaps any other person alive to advance the cause of unfettered global trade. A native of India, Bhagwati immigrated to the United States in the late 60s after a brief stint on the Indian Planning Commission, where he learned first-hand the insanity of an economic approach that tried to modernize a country by cutting it off from world trade.

Since then, he has devoted his efforts, both in academia and in the popular press, to showing that there is no better way of improving the lot of both advanced countries and the developing world than through free trade. His path-breaking contributions to trade theory have put him on the short list for a Nobel Prize in economics. 

Though a dogged trade advocate, Bhagwati is anything but dogmatic. He is a free spirit who draws intellectual inspiration from many disparate ideological camps. A self-avowed liberal, he is also something of a Gandhian social progressive, though Gandhi himself supported economic autarky. Bhagwati works with numerous Third World NGOs on a host of human rights issues. Yet he has no problem taking on these groups - or his famous student, Nobel laureate Paul Krugman - when they question the benefits of trade. 

In fact, he devoted his 2004 magnum opus, In Defense of Globalization, to a point-by-point rebuttal of these critics. Although he doesnt vote Republican because he dislikes the partys nationalistic jingoism, he readily declares that Democrats pose a far bigger threat to international exchange than Republicans. 

Last summer, Shikha Dalmia, a senior analyst at the Reason Foundation, interviewed Bhagwati in his New York office. For a transcript of that interview, go to http://reason.com.

This video interview was filmed on the same day and conducted by Dalmia, Reason Associate Editor Damon W. Root, and Reason.tv's Dan Hayes, who shot and edited the video. Approximately 6 minutes.

কাতালান নেতা চার্লস পুজডেমন্ড বলেছেন, স্বাধীনতা ঘোষণার দরজা খুলে গেছে, কাতালিয়ান নাগরিকরা স্বাধীন রাজ্য প্রতিষ্ঠার অধিকার লাভ করেছে। গতকাল সহিংসতার মধ্যে দিয়ে অনুষ্ঠিত গণভোটের ফলাফল ঘোষণার পর চার্লস এ মন্তব্য করেন।

SCRIPT

Activists in favour of Catalonia becoming independent from Spain showed their solidarity with Scottish independence supporters Wednesday in Glasgow, lighting coloured candles in the designs of the Scottish flag and the Catalan ""L'Estelada Blava"" (""The Blue Starred Flag"") independence flag.

An independence movement has long been active in Catalonia, and some supporters say Scottish independence from the Uk could give them renewed support. According to activist Llorenc Barrera, ""We want our voices heard.""

• Debate: State of play of negotiations with the United Kingdom
[2017/2847(RSP)]

Transcript:
Aside from the really important issue of Brexit, I think European citizens, those that do take any interest in what happens here, will be stunned that Mr Juncker comes here for his one appearance in the Strasbourg session this week and there is absolutely no mention made of the dramatic events that have taken place inside a European Union member state, that is allegedly a modern democracy.

One of the reasons that I always wanted Brexit was because I thought the system of law making whereby the Commission has the sole right to initiate legislation was something that would in fact damage, and in the end destroy, any concept of national democracy. And yeah, I’ve called the European Union undemocratic, I’ve called it antidemocratic, but never, ever in my fiercest criticisms here did I think we would see the police of a member state of the union injuring 900 people in an attempt to stop them going out to vote.

Whether or not it was legal nationally for people in Catalonia to have a vote, surely people are allowed to express an opinion. We saw women being dragged out of polling stations by their hair, old ladies with gashes in their forehead. The most extraordinary display and what do we get from Mr Juncker today? Not a dickie-bird.

In fact previously we had that the rule of law must be maintained and I think it is quite extraordinary to realise that this union is prepared to turn a blind eye. Can you imagine the British police would have roughed up a couple of Scottish National Party protestors or if something happened against a pro-Remain rally you’d all be screaming blue murder, indeed the calls would be that the United Kingdom must go before the European Court of Human Rights and yet with this you don’t even want to talk about it. Knowing as I do, your advance plans, seven of you members states here with your military police, your euro gendarmerie force, all I can say once again is thank god we’re leaving.

Brexit was an act of liberation, it was a voice of national self-determination that cannot and will not be stopped, but through this negotiating process I’m afraid from the start you’ve treated us as if we’re some kind of hostage. Unless we pay a ransom, unless we meet all of your demands, all of your demands, then you won’t even have an intelligent conversation with us about trade heading on from here.

There are no guarantees that whatever Mrs May says or does that you will ever, even when we’ve met your demands, that you will ever come to us and want to have a sensible trade agreement. And I have to say, that it is sad, in fact it was pitiful, to see the British Prime Minister in Florence. I heard you say that you thought she was being conciliatory, that she’s been grown up, people are happy with what she’s said. Actually Mrs May I’m sad to say isn’t worldly enough to recognise that when you face up to a bully the one thing that you do not do is try to appease them. She’s begging you to give her a transition period and there’s no guarantee that you will do it.

So I do actually agree with the criticisms that I’ve heard around the room about the mixed messages coming out from the UK government. I just hope that in Manchester the Conservative Party start to say in public what they’re all saying to me in private, that she’s a waste of space, she needs to go, that we need a proper Prime Minister who says to Monsieur Barnier ‘okay, here’s a deadline. Here’s a date, we work towards that date and if we can’t reach a sensible deal on trade and everything else then we are simply leaving and reverting to WTO rules.’ This charade cannot go on for year after year, after all we voted for Brexit.

The demonstrators also demanded freedom for the 14 far-right extremists who were imprisoned after they attacked the Blanquerna Cultural Centre on September 11, 2013, during Catalan National Day festivities.

Several people were injured, including a Catalonian politician from the Democratic Union of Catalonia, Josep Sanchez Llibre. The Supreme Court had considered the attack against the Blanquerna ""ideological discrimination.""

A free-trade area is the region encompassing a trade bloc whose member countries have signed a free-trade agreement (FTA). Such agreements involve cooperation between at least two countries to reduce trade barriers – import quotas and tariffs – and to increase trade of goods and services with each other. If people are also free to move between the countries, in addition to a free-trade agreement, it would also be considered an open border. It can be considered the second stage of economic integration.

Unlike a customs union (the third stage of economic integration), members of a free trade area do not have a common external tariff, which means they have different quotas and customs taxes, as well as other policies with respect to non-members. To avoid tariff evasion (through re-exportation) the countries use the system of certification of origin most commonly called rules of origin, where there is a requirement for the minimum extent of local material inputs and local transformations adding value to the goods. Only goods that meet these minimum requirements are entitled to the special treatment envisioned by the free trade area provisions.

Cumulation is the relationship between different FTAs regarding the rules of origin – sometimes different FTAs supplement each other, in other cases there is no cross-cumulation between the FTAs. A free-trade area is a result of a free-trade agreement (a form of trade pact) between two or more countries. Free-trade areas and agreements (FTAs) are cascadable to some degree – if some countries sign agreements to form a free-trade area and choose to negotiate together (either as a trade bloc or as a forum of individual members of their FTA) another free-trade agreement with another country (or countries) – then the new FTA will consist of the old FTA plus the new country (or countries).

Within an industrialized country there are usually few if any significant barriers to the easy exchange of goods and services between parts of that country. For example, there are usually no trade tariffs or import quotas; there are usually no delays as goods pass from one part of the country to another (other than those that distance imposes); there are usually no differences of taxation and regulation. Between countries, on the other hand, many of these barriers to the easy exchange of goods often do occur. It is commonplace for there to be import duties of one kind or another (as goods enter a country) and the levels of sales tax and regulation often vary by country..

The aim of a free-trade area is to reduce barriers to exchange so that trade can grow as a result of specialisation, division of labour, and most importantly via comparative advantage. The theory of comparative advantage argues that in an unrestricted marketplace (in equilibrium) each source of production will tend to specialize in that activity where it has comparative (rather than absolute) advantage. The theory argues that the net result will be an increase in income and ultimately wealth and well-being for everyone in the free-trade area. But the theory refers only to aggregate wealth and says nothing about the distribution of wealth; in fact there may be significant losers, in particular among the recently protected industries with a comparative disadvantage. In principle, the overall gains from trade could be used to compensate for the effects of reduced trade barriers by appropriate inter-party transfers.",The Audiopedia,"dictionary', 'english dictionary', 'online dictionary', 'vocabulary', 'english vocabulary', 'online vocabulary', 'how to pronounce words', 'what do words mean', 'free-trade area', 'what is free-trade area', 'free-trade area meaning', 'free-trade area definition', 'free-trade area explanation', 'what is the meaning of free-trade area', 'what is the definition of free-trade area', 'what does free-trade area mean', 'what does free-trade area stand for'",PT3M59S,239,Free Trade,4

__

Many people assume that importing goods from other countries destroys jobs here in the U.S. IS that true?  Economists believe that trade doesn't destroy jobs, it just moves them around within the economy. The idea is that trading with other nations lowers consumer prices, and those consumers buy things they couldn't have afforded before - creating jobs to replace those lost to trade.

The court on Wednesday issued a summons for Cuixart, along with two senior officers of Catalonia's regional police force and another leader of a pro-Catalan independence civic group, who have all been placed under investigation for sedition.
During a media briefing Cuixart said the prosecutors' report is ""full of inaccuracies""
The four people summoned will be questioned on Friday about their roles in demonstrations on September 20 and 21 in Barcelona, when Spanish police arrested several Catalan government officials and raided offices in a crackdown on preparations for the referendum.
Spanish authorities say the demonstrations hindered the police operation.

The strike was called to protest alleged brutality by police forces that tried to stop a referendum on the region's secession from Spain that left hundreds of people injured.
The strike call came as regional authorities and political parties studied a possible declaration of independence this week following the referendum that Spain said was illegal and invalid.
Port workers were being called to demonstrate on Tuesday outside the regional headquarters of Spain's ruling Popular Party, while firefighters planned a rally outside the Interior Ministry's regional office in the Catalan capital of Barcelona.
Protests were also to be staged outside polling stations where police acted with force to try to prevent Sunday's poll being held.

Mr. Olmsted and co-author Mark Blaxill researched the use of mercury throughout recent history and conclude, in part, that the use of mercury and other heavy metals in vaccines is a root cause for the rise in Autism. And for good reason: mercury is the second most lethal substance to humans (behind plutonium), and hundreds of times more toxic than lead, and yet it has been injected into infants, babies and children in the name of ""medicine.""  

Another metal used in vaccines - aluminum - is also extremely toxic. Flu shots contain organic mercury, which is many times more toxic than the mercury found in a thermometer. The use of extremely toxic substances in ""medicine"" - especially heavy metals like mercury - causes an untold number of neurological problems in children, including Autism. 

Two unique problems that most Autistic children share in common are very serious digestive problems, and an inability to excrete heavy metals, such as mercury. Mercury poisoning will actually *cause* both of these health problems. For those already exposed, the solution is alternative medicine treatment that helps repair the gut and eliminate toxic metals from the body. 

If you have a child with Autism, there is hope. Find a DAN! doctor near you and visit him/her. Parents have recovered children - either fully, or mostly - because of the alternative medicine steps they took, and so can you.

Watch Part 1: Inside Catalonia’s Battle Over Independence From Spain https://youtu.be/P9k0yb4dtoQ

The country is home to the two top teams in the world, Football Club Barcelona, or “Barça,” and Real Madrid. Barça is a premier symbol of Catalan identity and pride, while Real Madrid is seen to represent the Spanish crown and Madrid’s rule over Catalonia. As the battle over Catalan independence hits crisis levels, AJ+’s Dena Takruri hangs out with Catalan soccer fans, for whom stadiums are a symbolic battleground over the future of this region.

itO_AwaJlj8,2012-10-08T08:36:24.000Z,UC8cZ8ne4wZZ2_SyzqmIxYFA,ᴴᴰ Huge clamour at Camp Nou for Catalonian independence. Crits d'Independència en el Clàssic,"The large majority of the almost 100,000 supporters who this Sunday filled Camp Nou to watch the 'Clasico' between Barcelona FC and Real Madrid in the seventh La Liga encounter, shouted for Catalonian independence 17 minutes and 14 seconds into the first half during a match with several politically significant actions such as, the large 'Senyera' Catalan flag on the terraces that greeted both teams.

The moment arrived -- symbolic for the 11 September 1714, Catalonia Day, when Barcelona fell in the War of Succession - and the spectators began chanting 'In, inde, independència' and waved thousands of 'Senyeras' and 'Esteladas' (Catalan independence flags) as called for by various quarters over recent days, among them the Catalan National Assembly (ANC).

Prior to the match, the fans were already singing for independence and the 'Blaugrana' stadium was decorated with a giant mosaic featuring the 'Senyera' and the word 'Barça' made up of 98,000 coloured cards that was displayed when the players took to the pitch and while Barça's anthem was played over the loudspeaker. A banner could also be seen featuring the slogan 'Catalonia next European state'.

La gran mayoría de los aficionados han clamado a favor de la independencia de Cataluña en el minuto 17 con 14 segundos de la primera parte, en un partido con diversas acciones con significación política.

Llegado este minuto -simbólico por su coincidencia con el 11 de septiembre de 1714, Diada de Cataluña, cuando Barcelona cayó derrotada en la Guerra de Sucesión-, el público se ha arrancado con gritos de 'In, inde, independència' y ha ondeado miles de 'senyeras' y 'esteladas', como habían pedido determinadas plataformas los últimos días, entre ellas la Assemblea Nacional Catalana (ANC).

Antes del inicio del encuentro, la afición ya había cantado a favor de la independencia y el estadio blaugrana se ha engalanado con un mosaico gigante formado por 98.000 cartulinas con los colores de la 'senyera' y la palabra 'Barça!' como protagonistas, que ha lucido cuando los jugadores han saltado al campo y mientras sonaba el himno del Barça por megafonía.

J-qGCZ4wmxs,2015-10-16T16:22:54.000Z,UC1SOycTKnyGVuy-Ufl_9oDw,What is Free Trade ?,"Free trade exists when nations can swap goods and services without the constraints of tariffs, duties or quotas.
Free trade lets nations concentrate on manufacturing their specialties, which are typically products other nations can’t make or produce as well. With revenues from selling such goods, nations can buy products from other nations that they need.
For example, say two countries sit across an ocean from one another. One specializes in raising beef, but has fallen behind in technological fields. The other country makes some of the world’s best electronics, but needs more beef. The two nations enter into a free trade agreement. Each lowers tariffs exporters must pay and begin importing the other’s specialty.
There are instances where governments restrict free trade in order to support local businesses and boost employment. But free trade is largely considered beneficial for nations that participate. It enables them to focus on core competitive advantages, thereby maximizing economic output and fostering growth.
Nations like China and India started expanding faster when they adopted free trade principles in the 1980s and 1990s. Many nations are members of the World Trade Organization, which aims to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably and freely as possible.

j0pl_FXt0eM,2009-07-15T00:44:12.000Z,UCGWWzMfkObMozqdLWr_aTtg,Free Trade and the Steel Industry,"Dr. Milton Friedman gives a concise and lucid argument for international free trade at Utah State University in 1978.

A common belief is that big companies will sell below cost to drive out their competitors and then raise their prices.  This is a fallacy and there are few professional economists who believe otherwise. Historian Thomas E. Woods offers a simple explanation in this video: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6dD-ifIr8s

For an example of the steel industry's anti-free enterprise rhetoric listen to Dan DiMicco, CEO of Nucor, one of the largest steel producers in the United States, during this interview with Lesley Stahl of '60 minutes'. In this example, just as Dr. Friedman professed, Nucor benefits at the expense of Caterpillar which relies not only on steel, but exports as well.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYyrqSmhals

The anti-free trade protectionists will say we need exports to create American jobs. But, they say, we need tariffs and import quotas to protect American jobs from ""unfair"" competition. This is another fallacy as Dr. Friedman explains. When you impose tariffs on imports you hurt exports as well! To understand this better read the following:

http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html

We hear many people constantly lamenting the fact that the American manufacturing sector is dead or dying. (Just read the comments section of this video!) This has been repeated so often that it has become conventional wisdom. This is another myth not supported by any evidence. In fact, the data shows the opposite is true: America is BY FAR the world's largest manufacturing nation. Our output is higher now than it has EVER been in history.

The Continental Free Trade Area is a continent-wide free-trade agreement brokered by the African Union. The agreement was initially signed on by 44 of its 55 member states in Rwanda earlier this year. 
It is intended to create a pan-African market and encourage intra-Africa trade. However, two of the largest national economies, South Africa and Nigeria, have not yet signed the CFTA.

And why isn't the sudden onset of neurological illnesses in children being treated as an urgent crisis by our government and medical industries?

Join baby Jack and his #parents as they find out how #vaccines help train your baby’s immune system to help prevent disease in this #HowVaccinesWork video.

Vaccines contain a small number of weakened or dead antigens, the parts of germs that cause a baby’s immune system to go to work. After babies receive a vaccine, their immune system will remember that antigen and attack it if it ever enters the body again. Vaccines only contain a tiny fraction of the antigens that babies encounter in their everyday surroundings. 

It may take a few weeks for a vaccine to start working. Babies may also need more doses later to protect them. That’s why the recommended immunization schedule exists: it’s designed to give babies the best protection against 14 serious diseases by two years old. 

Learn more about #childhood immunizations by visiting https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/childhood-vaccines or talk with your child’s doctor.

A descriptive transcript for this video is available by visiting the following link:

Prior to World War II, states routinely taxed goods imported into their country. Although this makes domestic products more competitive within the country's own borders, the tariff system led to an overall inefficient economic system. Why were taxes the norm back then, and why is it so difficult to establish free trade?

Modeling free trade as a prisoner's dilemma provides an explanation. Although everyone is collectively better off with free trade, individual incentives tell states to place tariffs on imported goods. Thus, although the result is collectively crazy, it is individually rational.

Yet, in the post-World War II era, free trade has become the norm. As such, this video raises a new question: how is free trade sustainable given the prisoner's dilemma logic? We will explore this type of cooperation after the next lesson.",William Spaniel,"international', 'relations', 'political', 'science', 'tariffs', 'free', 'trade', ""prisoner's"", 'dilemma', 'NAFTA', 'International Relations (Field Of Study)'",PT8M34S,514,Free Trade,9

Free trade agreements are designed to improve business links with important partners around the world. In addition to the EFTA agreement and the free trade agreement with the European Union, Switzerland currently has a network of 28 free trade agreements with 38 partners outside the EU, and new agreements are continually being negotiated. A current overview of the network of Swiss free trade agreements can be found in the section List of free trade agreements:

Free trade agreements are designed to improve business links with important partners around the world. In addition to the EFTA agreement and the free trade agreement with the European Union, Switzerland currently has a network of 28 free trade agreements, and new agreements are continually being negotiated.
Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) make life easier, because they minimize or eliminate barriers to international markets. The essential component of every agreement is trade in merchandise, which reduces or eliminates customs duties and other trade restrictions. Trade and unprocessed agricultural products tend to be regulated at separated agricultural agreements. There are also so-called second generation agreements. These include the protection of intellectual property rights, trade and services, investments, public procurement and technical regulations. Did you know that no other country has as large a network of FTAs as Switzerland has? In 2012 trade with only five important EU countries resulted in duty savings of 1 billion Swiss francs. Did you also know that 51 % of Switzerland's exports to markets outside the EU are realized through FTA? FTA offers several benefits. Most important, they promote the growth, added value and competitiveness of Switzerland as a business location. Swiss exporters and importers benefit from the savings in customs duties. Here's an example of an FTA's benefits: let's say you are the export manager of a Swiss manufacturer of dishwashers. Your company is only active in Europe and you want to export to China. So you call the experts at Switzerland Global Enterprise. We are pleased to inform you that you can save up to 14 % in customs duties for your dishwasher if it meets the specific rules of origin of the FTA between Switzerland and China. In this example, the value criterion allows a maximum share of 50 % by a third country. Remember: your European competitor pays 14 % in custom expenses as long as the EU doesn't have an FTA with China. Let's say your merchandise value is 100000 Swiss francs: this means with an FTA you save 14000 Swiss francs in customs duties. And it's easy! Your company creates a proof of origin and ships the goods to China. The result? You are happy because your Chinese client is happy, and we are happy to help you. Switzerland Global Enterprise offers a wide range of support measures, events, online tools, expert database, studies and fact sheets, customs tariffs worldwide and our FTA map for the best overview. Switzerland Global Enterprise – enabling new business. If you have any questions regarding free trade agreements, please contact our expert help department.

The UK government intends to roll over these agreements so that they continue to apply, known as grandfathering.

However, because of Rules of Origin and clauses in some of these agreements, it’s not likely to be a simple cut out ‘EU’ and paste in ‘UK’ job. This video explains why rolling over these agreements is likely to be highly complicated, and will necessarily impact on trade.

Most members have connections to the pharmaceutical (aka vaccine) industry.

This 4-minute video was taken from a recent ACIP meeting discussing the approval of a new Hepatitis B vaccine for ADULTS. The vaccine uses a new ingredient that has NEVER been used before...

Pre-approval studies signaled an increase in heart attacks…but under pressure from vaccine makers, the committee unanimously APPROVES the vaccine.

Meaning…YOU ARE THE TEST SUBJECT!

But your doctor won’t tell you that...

Learn The Risk is a parent-driven grassroots campaign to raise awareness of the real dangers of pharmaceutical products. The non-profit organization was founded by an ex-pharmaceutical employee and parent in response to the industry’s unprecedented assault on parental rights and health freedom by funding laws that take our right to say “NO” away.

Hundreds gathered in downtown Barcelona to watch a public viewing on the big screen as 12 Catalonian independence leaders gave their testimonies, on the final day of their four-month trial.

Audiences cheered and applauded as the independence leaders voiced their final statements, arguing that the 2017 failed push for Catalan independence was a political, rather than criminal issue, and should be treated as such. Scores of banners reading ""We will do it again"" could be seen among the crowd.

Nine of the defendants, including former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras, face charges of rebellion, which carry sentences of 25 years. Others were charged with sedition and the misuse of public funds. Judges are expected to reach a decision on the case in several months.

http://www.euronews.com/2013/10/18/eu-canada-agree-free-trade-deal
The EU and Canada have tentatively agreed a free trade deal after more than four years of negotiations.

It is expected to increase bilateral trade in goods and services by a fifth to 25.7 billion euros a year, according to the latest EU estimates.

The EU and Canada did more than 80 billion euros in such trade in 2012, according to Commission figures.

European Commission President José Manuel Barroso said it could set the tone for a similar deal planned with the US.

""Certainly, on our side, that we expect this agreement to set some standards also  for other negotiations, including those with our American, United States friends. ""

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said the agreement would also be good news for consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.

""98 percent of tariffs both ways will be removed immediately upon implementation of this agreement,"" he told reporters, referring to the cut in duties on goods. 

Differences over agriculture hampered the talks.

Canada demanded increased market access in Europe for its beef and pork, while boosting exports of Europe's cheeses had been another of the main stumbling blocks.

But it is not just about lifting quotas and scrapping tarrifs on goods.

If approved by EU leaders, MEPs and Canada's provinces, it would also make it easier for European companies to sell services in Canada and vice-versa.

Regulatory barriers that limit trade will also be scrapped.

For example Canada, will now recognise EU automotive standards.

The detailed text of the agreement is still to be made public.

Euronews' Brussels correspondent James Franey said: 

""The EU-Canada deal is being seen as a blueprint for the recently launched free trade talks between Brussels and Washington; another example of how governments worldwide favour bilateral agreements on trade and investment.

We outline why some Catalans want independence from Spain, and why only 41% are likely to vote yes

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 

Tensions are rising in Catalonia. An independence referendum is planned for October 1st and if the majority vote Yes the Catalan government says it will declare independence from Spain.

Raul Romeva is a member of the Catalan parliament, which favours independence. A parliament set on a collision course with the Spanish government.

Xavier Albiol is the leader of the Catalan branch of Spain's ruling People's Party. His party fiercely opposes the referendum that has been deemed illegal by the Spanish constitutional court. Police have raided Catalan government offices, seized ballot papers, and arrested at least 12 officials in a bid to stop the vote.

Catalonia has been part of Spain since the country first emerged as a unified kingdom in 1469. Famous for its spectacular human towers, a tradition dating back to the 18th century, Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest regions incorporating the tourist hub of Barcelona and a thriving manufacturing industry. It already enjoys more self-government than almost any other European region.

So why are many Catalans discontented with their lot?

The Democrat-led Senate and Assembly voted Thursday to repeal the exemption, which allows parents to cite religious beliefs to forego getting their child the vaccines required for school enrollment.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the measure minutes after the final vote. The law takes effect immediately but will give unvaccinated students up to 30 days after they enter a school to show they've had the first dose of each required immunization.

With New York's move, similar exemptions are still allowed in 45 states, though lawmakers in several of them have introduced their own legislation to eliminate the waiver.

The issue is hotly contested and debate around it has often been emotional, pitting cries that religious freedom is being curtailed against warnings that public health is being endangered. After the vote in the Assembly, many of those watching from the gallery erupted in cries of ""shame!"" One woman yelled obscenities down to the lawmakers below.

The debate has only intensified with this year's measles outbreak , which federal officials recently said has surpassed 1,000 illnesses, the highest in 27 years.

""I'm not aware of anything in the Torah, the Bible, the Koran or anything else that suggests you should not get vaccinated,"" said Bronx Democrat Jeffrey Dinowitz, the bill's Assembly sponsor. ""If you choose to not vaccinate your child, therefore potentially endangering other children ... then you're the one choosing not to send your children to school.""

Hundreds of parents of unvaccinated children gathered at New York's Capitol for the vote to protest.

Stan Yung, a Long Island attorney and father, said his Russian Orthodox religious views and health concerns about vaccines will prevent him from vaccinating his three young children. His family, he said, may consider leaving the state.

""People came to this country to get away from exactly this kind of stuff,"" Yung said ahead of Thursday's votes.

Supporters of the bill say religious beliefs about vaccines shouldn't eclipse scientific evidence that they work, noting the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1905 that states have the right to enforce compulsory vaccination laws. During the Assembly's floor debate, supporters brought up scourges of the past that were defeated in the U.S. through vaccines.

""I'm old enough to have been around when polio was a real threat,"" said Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, D-Manhattan. ""I believe in science.... Your personal opinions, which may be based on junk science, do not trump the greater good.""

Supporters also suggest some parents may be claiming the religious exemption for their children even though their opposition is actually based on scientifically discredited claims about the dangers of vaccines.

The bill would not change an existing state exemption given to children who cannot have vaccines for medical reasons, such as a weakened immune system.

Cuomo told reporters on Wednesday that he believes public health — and the need to protect those who cannot get vaccinated because for medical reasons — outweighs the concerns about religious freedom.

""I understand freedom of religion,"" he said. ""I have heard the anti-vaxxers' theory, but I believe both are overwhelmed by the public health risk.""

The current measles outbreak has renewed concern about the exemptions in many states. The nation last saw as many cases in 1992, when more than 2,200 were reported.

The majority of cases are from outbreaks in New York in Orthodox Jewish communities.

California removed personal belief vaccine exemptions for children in both public and private schools in 2015, after a measles outbreak at Disneyland sickened 147 people and spread across the U.S. and into Canada. Maine ended its religious exemption earlier this year.

Mississippi and West Virginia also do not allow religious exemptions.

Once common in the U.S., measles became rare after vaccination campaigns that started in the 1960s. A decade ago, there were fewer than 100 cases a year.

But FEAR NOT!

There is almost no topic in health and health policy that immediately polarizes people more than the idea that vaccines cause autism. Even though the original big paper on this topic came out at the end of the last century, the anger this causes is still raw and potent. But there is a very, very large amount of research showing that vaccines and autism are unrelated. Please, watch the video before you jump down my throat.

OaTpYg5O-EY,2013-09-17T07:43:37.000Z,UCDCgvwyjJqZWYs6j0D2FF6g,Brussels says an independent Catalonia would need to leave EU,"Brussels warned on Monday that the Spanish northeastern region of Catalonia would no longer be an EU member state if it becomes independent from Spain.
The European Commission decided on Monday to indirectly set out its position on the Catalan self-determination debate, after it refused to comment on last weeks' pro-independence mass protest in Catalonia. 
Answering increasing demands from the Catalan government and the Spanish press, a top EU official said that any new independent state would become ' a third country'. 
'Scenarios such as the separation of one part of a member state or the creation of a new state, as we have recall on numerous occasions, would not be neutral as regards to the EU treaties.
I think what vice-president Almunia said is entirely in line with what I have just said (...)  So in other words, an independent state, because of tis independence, would become a third country vis a vis the EU and as of the day of the independence the EU treaties will no longer apply', said European Commission spokesperson Pia 

The warning came after European Commission vice-president Joaquin Almunia said on Monday  that if part of a member state becomes independent, ""the segrated part is not an EU member."".
Speaking in the Catalan city of Barcelona, Almunia also expressed the Commission's concern over the situation in Catalonia and urged the Spanish and Catalan authorities to come to an agreement.
The Commission spokesperson said, however, that the EU executive would only lay out an official legal analysis on the situation if a members state requested so. 

'We would only express our opinion on the legal consequences under EU law on request from a member state detailing a precise scenario. 
Any European state which complies with the principles set out in article 2 of the EU treaty may request membership of the union. So those are the rules. So I think this is what Mr. Almunia was referring to'.

Forming a 400 km human chain across the region, over 1.5 million people took to the streets of Catalonia last Wednesday to demand independence from Spain.

Reason is the planet's leading source of news, politics, and culture from a libertarian perspective. Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.

------------------------------------------------------

Many Californians are upset about Donald Trump. Some are so upset that they are working to get a referendum on the ballot in 2018. It would ask Californians if their state should leave the United States and become an independent country — which it once was, back in 1846.

But IF they vote to leave — will the rest of America let them? Maybe not, if Spain's reaction to a similar movement is any guide. A region called Catalonia wants to secede from the rest of Spain. But the Spanish government says that is illegal and sent thousands of police to stop Catalonians from even voting about whether they want to leave. The police brutally assaulted many people trying to vote.

Catalonia's regional Parliament responded with a declaration of independence from Spain — but the Spanish authorities then dissolved the parliament and arrested many leaders who favored secession. Other leaders have fled the country and are trying to convince the EU to give Catalonia independence.

Stossel hopes they succeed, because if people don't want to be governed by their government — and would prefer another — let them choose! It also means more governments, and more competition among governments, which should lead to better laws.

As libertarian Michael Strong puts it, ""we need lots of experiments. It's funny — in the world of science, we believe in freedom to experiment; now we need to go to the world of government and believe in freedom to experiment.""

OotcOCy7JQQ,2015-04-23T05:31:05.000Z,UCBVzV4f_JjDyZb8Vl6_dvEA,Anti-vaccine cult liken immunisation to rape,"The owner of the Australian Vaccination Sceptics Network Facebook page, Meryl Dorey, has for the second time in her running of the groups page published a post likening immunisation to rape.
The first post of this nature was on January 15, 2011 in response to a court ordering a mother to have her 5 year old daughter vaccinated.
Dorey wailed, ""Court orders rape of a child. Think this is an exaggeration? This is assault without consent and full penetration too..."".
See screenshot:
https://reasonablehank.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/avn-6944-dorey-rape-with-full-penetration-january-2011.jpg
The result was an immediate loss of members followed by a puerile insistence by Dorey that some archaic definitions that list ""plunder, despoil, seize and carry off by force"" as types of rape justify her comment.
This time again disgusted page members rose in large number to condemn such an affront to reason with at least one member publicly announcing she would be quitting Dorey's page immediately. Once the media got hold of the story the post was deleted, and childish lies claiming innocence began to surface - to great amusement on social media.

Dorey has reacted again, by predictably presenting her ""dictionary"" to insist rape is merely general medieval abuse - despite the image she used of a man attacking a woman from behind with the words, ""Forced Penetration. Really it's no big deal if it's just a vaccination needle and he's a doctor - do you really need control over your own choices?""
Incredibly, AVSN group leader Meryl Dorey, and Tasha David the current so-called ""president"" insist their page does not belong to the group - even though they hold administration privileges.
They pleaded innocence, further demolishing their credibility by insisting they have ""no control"" over what appears on the page - albeit content contains their signatures.
AUSTRALIAN DOCTOR reported on the public statement posted on the groups Facebook page with input from Meryl Dorey pushing the evidence-free myth that vaccines kill large numbers of children. 

""Australian Doctor attempted to contact the AVSN by phone, however the number listed for the organisation on its webpage was disconnected.
The group — based in Bangalow on the NSW north coast and formerly known as the Australian Vaccination Network — made a public statement over Facebook disowning any relationship between the AVSN Facebook page and the actual organisation.
It admitted the image posted was in poor taste but also queried why there was such great media interest in the meme when they apparently ignored “children who are killed"".
AVSN spokeswoman Meryl Dorey said: “I agree that the image was very much in-your-face and should not have been posted here, but I am also (once again) floored that this has become a media issue whilst the children who are killed and permanently injured, and their families that are often destroyed, remain in the shadows as far as the press is concerned.
'Let's get back to the issue at hand and agree that the important thing to do is to focus on the immorality of forced vaccination.' ""

Hi friends............Welcome to abmbbs.......Today's topic is MEASLES....First up Measles is caused by Paramyxovirus which is a RNA virus.....

next, what is the incubation period of measles??it is 10 to 14days.......now if you consider this to be the timeline.....& this as the point of exposure on day 0....then.....fever occurs on day 10 & rash occurs on day 14.
But remember......the incubation period of vaccine induced measles is only 7 days...

next, the source of measles infection is from cases.... there is no carrier in measles...there is no animal reservoir too.....

the mode of transmission of measles is by air droplets

the period of communicability of measles is from 4 days before to 4 days after the appearance of rash...

the Secondary attack rate of measles is 80%

measles also shows seasonal trend every 2 to 3 yrs....and it mainly occurs in the period of january to april that is in early spring

the clinical features of measles is divided into 3 stages......the 1st stage which is the prodromal stage causes fever, coryza & nasal discharge...............in the eruptive stage dusky red coloured maculopapular rash occurs....like this.....mind you the rash begins from behind the ear....that is it has retro auricular origin.
….................................in this stage koplik spot also occurs.....like this....this one....& this one....it is a characteristic sign of measles......it occurs in the buccal mucosa opposite the 2nd molar............................finally there is the Post measles stage which is characterised by wt loss & diarrhoea.


Next, the complications of measles....otitis media is the most common complication.....& pneumonia is the most common life threatening complication....another late complication of measles is called SSPE which stands for sub acute sclerosing pan encephalitis....it is extremely rare & occurs in about 7 per million cases of measles.

Finally we come to the topic of measles vaccine....this one.........it is a live attenuated freeze dried lyophilised vaccine....i have explained the meaning of each of these words in my previous video on BCG vaccination....the link is available right here...

the measles vaccine is most commonly derived from the Edmonston zagreb strain

what is the dose?....the dose is 0.5ml given subcutaneously in the antero lateral aspect of thigh.

The diluent used is distilled water & not normal saline

the vaccine is to be stored at 2 to 8 degree celsius...

the measles vaccine is  remarkable since it not only gives a protective efficacy of 90% with just the 1st dose but also gives lifelong protection
bt it is susceptable to light & must be stored in dark vials

finally when is the measles vaccine given??......it is given exactly at 9 months age......why?.....bcz till 9 months the maternal antibodies protect the baby & any vaccination before that would be rendered ineffective by the natural antibodies acquired from the mother. 
But immunization later than 9 months means that many children will contract measles in the interval between the weaning off of the natural antibodies & the introduction of the vaccine.So the WHO expanded immunization program has recommended immunization at 9 months & india has adopted the same.

The Republican Party's U-turn on free trade is the sad story of a team of presidential advisers with two opinions for every man. It's a cautionary tale of how the temptations of political power promote personality over principle.

Before Trump took office, his advisers stood for free trade, which Ronald Reagan helped make central to the GOP.

Take former Congressman Mike Pence. In the House of Representatives, he voted to normalize trade relations with China. He praised NAFTA, voted for the Central American Free Trade Agreement, supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and backed free trade agreements with Australia, Singapore, Chile, and Peru.

Even though Pence represented a state with over a hundred thousand auto workers, he voted against then-president Obama's corporate bailouts on principle.

After joining team Trump, Pence was a changed man. Rescued from an unpopular governorship, Pence was thrust into the national spotlight and his political career was given a new life—and more importantly, a new identity.

His conversion to protectionism was so sudden and complete that he had a hard time convincing journalists of his new faith.

As Pence hit the talk show circuit, we learned that the trade agreements he had supported over his political career were now ""bad deal[s]"" and ""up for renegotiation."" A month before he was sworn in as vice president, Pence went from badmouthing banking bailouts to bankrolling the Carrier corporation in his home state. One year after supporting free trade with China, he declared it enemy number one.

About the same time, Trump's campaign adviser Stephen Moore and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus were stressing key elements of protectionism in their speeches and public appearances. Moore told a group of top Republicans that the Grand Old Party was no longer the party of Ronald Reagan. ""I used to be a free trader,"" he said. ""The political reality is there's a backlash against trade. Whether we like it or not, we better adapt the rules in ways that benefit American workers more, or free trade is not going to flourish.""

The Republican Party's bedrock principles are shifting at the rate of one presidential adviser at a time. After a year in office, members of Trump's economic team have either adopted the commander in chief's line on trade, or kept a low profile, or resigned.

As the U.S follows other countries down the path of economic nationalism, advocates for free trade are losing their voice. Fewer are making a compelling public case for free trade, as Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman did for decades.

It's a worldview that Moore, Priebus, Kudlow, and Vice President Pence all shared before joining team Trump and that Ronald Reagan stood up for inconsistently in the 1980s. Although NAFTA and the precursor to the World Trade Organization were born from his administration, Reagan also raised a 100 percent tariff on Japanese electronics, and a 45 percent tariff on Japanese motorcycles. He slapped export quotas on cars and machine tools and Canadian lumber and sugar. Enough economic nationalism to make our current protectionist-in-chief proud.

Which goes to say: Maybe president Trump is more Reagan-esque than he gives even himself credit for.

In an editorial, leading Spanish daily El Pais blamed the Catalan government for Sunday's ""shameful"" events but also criticised the Spanish government for its inability to tackle the crisis since it began about seven years ago. The newspaper said the day was ""a defeat for our country.""
People in Madrid on Monday were split on the subject with some saying the central government had had no choice but to take action, while others called their actions disproportionate.
Catalonia's government will hold a closed-door Cabinet meeting on Monday to discuss the next steps in its plan to declare independence from Spain following the disputed referendum.
Regional officials say the vote, which Spain insists was illegal and invalid, shows that a majority favour secession.
The referendum debacle brought both Spain and Catalonia closer to a potentially disastrous showdown as each side said Sunday's events proved them right and neither looked prepared to cede ground.

""This document you have written breaks the holiest thing for people in Catalonia, it breaks the co-existence, it deprives them of their citizenship.""

Many of MPs left Spanish and Catalan flags on their pews in their absence.

The vote went ahead and saw 70 representatives voted in favour, with ten against and two abstinences, while Catalan President Carles Puigdemont cast the final of the 82 votes before the Speaker Carme Forcadell declared the result.

It follows the Spanish central government's plans to invoke Article 155 which would impose direct rule by Madrid over Catalonia.

STORYLINE:

President George W. Bush signed a free trade agreement with six Latin American countries on Tuesday, celebrating a victory in Congress so narrow and grueling that it cast doubt on the future of other trade-opening pacts the administration is negotiating.

Bush's signature at a ceremony in the East Room of the White House put the final touch on the Central American Free Trade Agreement.

The measure was approved by Congress last week with just a two-vote margin in the House after a bruising battle over the future of US trade policy.

That 217-215 vote handed the president an important political victory after months of intense lobbying by the president and his trade officials.

Speaking at the signing ceremony, Bush said ""CAFTA is more than a trade bill.""   

He said the measure would help strengthen fragile young democracies in Latin America and show those countries that the United States would stand by their side.

The agreement, with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, removes trade barriers and opens up the region to US goods and services. 

It also takes steps to facilitate investment in the area and strengthens protections for intellectual property.

The measure drew heavy Democratic opposition as well as some Republican defections. 

Critics argued that it would send more US jobs overseas, although Bush argued the opposite.

Bush said it would open more markets in the region to American goods.

He has also cast the measure as an important component of his second-term vow to spread democracy and freedom throughout the world to combat terrorism.

Joining Bush at the ceremony were congressional sponsors of the pact and committee leaders and diplomats from the countries that are signatories.

pQsIIhSrbOY,2017-10-04T09:34:53.000Z,UCt-WqkTyKK1_70U4bb4k4lQ,"Catalonia referendum: Catalonia's long fight for independence, explained - TomoNews","BARCELONA — On October 1, 2017, Catalonia voted for independence, despite massive opposition from the central Spanish government.

BBC reports that the northeast region of Catalonia is one of Spain's 17 autonomous communities. It's home to 7.5 million people, and has its own distinct language, history, and culture.

Catalonia was once under the kingdom of Aragon, which unified with Castile in the 15th century. It remained a state until it was defeated in the 1714 Siege of Barcelona, and its sovereignty was abolished. Under the newly centralized Spanish realm, Catalans were forced to adopt the Castilian language and customs.

The region regained autonomy when Spain became a republic in 1931, but lost it again during the Franco dictatorship. Franco's death restored democracy, allowing Catalonia to have its own Parliament, police force, and education system.

Though they have a high degree of autonomy, Catalans are not satisfied with the central government.

As Spain's wealthiest region, it generates 20% of the national GDP. But high budget cuts during the 2008 financial crisis, and complaints of paying more taxes than they get back have increased separatist sentiment.

The Brookings Institute reports that in 2010, the Spanish Constitutional Court reversed a 2006 ruling that granted the region 'nation' status and its own tax system, angering many and fueling the movement for independence.

This movement culminated in the October 1 referendum, which Madrid has called illegal.

A Catalonian secession would impact the Spanish economy, but also see the region out of the EU. With no free trade, the region's economy could shrink, and the unemployment rate could double.

But do all Catalans want independence? Polls taken before the referendum showed that while 70% wanted the right to vote, only 41% sought independence.

Still, Madrid's response was aggressive. It arrested Catalan leaders, and took down websites and apps in an effort to thwart the vote.

On the day of the referendum, violence erupted as police seized ballots, and forcibly stopped people from voting. Despite the danger, voter turnout was at 42.3%, with nearly 90% of those who voted backing secession.

Catalan's president has said he will declare independence within 48 hours if the 'yes' side won. If this happens, Spain will enter a constitutional crisis and may be forced to suspend Catalonia's autonomy.

Kishore Jayabalan explains the ideal of authentically free trade in contrast with the current protectionism of the Western nations.

""Free trade presents many challenges and opportunities to the poor. I would say that free trade, at a very short-term level, causes all kinds of disruptions. So, it looks like free trade can actually hurt the poor. But if you allow free trade and think about the economics behind free trade, what you're doing is you're allowing poor people the opportunity to engage in production and exchange with their richer neighbors. And not only are you creating an economic bond between the rich and the poor, through trade, you're creating a moral bond between the rich and the poor. We all know the experience of going to a market and getting to know a shop owner. Now, imagine if you could somehow expand that to, let's say, the city, or expand that within a country. Not only are you creating more economically-efficient systems, but you're creating a whole system of social interaction, where people feel much more involved in the lives of society and of each other.""

FRANCE 24 live news stream: all the latest news 24/7
http://f24.my/YTliveEN

Spain is a notoriously decenteralized country. The Spanish Constitution grants 17 autonomous regions varying degrees of political autonomy in health, education, security, urban and environmental policy. But the 1978 Constitution also contains a safeguard for the Spanish government. Article 155 allows the central government to take control over autonomous regions in times of crisis. DLS Article 155 Spanish Constitution: If a self-governing Community does not fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the Constitution or other laws, or acts in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of Spain, the Government, (…) may, following approval granted by the overall majority of the Senate, take all measures necessary to compel the Community to meet said obligations, or to protect the above mentioned general interest. The article is short and relatively imprecise... The second paragraph vaguely stipulates that the government ""may issue instructions to all the authorities of the Self-governing Communities"" Article 155  has never been used, making it difficult to know how it would be applied in practice.  According to this specialist, the government could choose between a number of different measures to restrict Catalonia''s autonomy. SOT Oriol Bartomeus, political science professor Autonomous University of Barcelona: ""it could be anything from economic intervention to control over the autonomous police forces, or even control over the region''s institutions. And we could even get to a point where the government makes the decision to dissolve the regional parlement and hold early elections. 
   To trigger Article 155, Mariano Rajoy will have to submit the exact measures he intends to apply to a vote in the Spanish Senate.

Mr Rajoy said the government had no choice in seeking to impose direct rule, arguing that the Catalan government's actions were ""contrary to the law and seeking confrontation"".

The protesters armed with colored powder and the Policemen with shields and batons. many reported ""I saw a policeman brutally beating a protester"" 

Thousands of pro-independence took to the streets of Barcelona today 29.09.2018 to oppose a march by Spanish police unions that wanted to honor officers that took part in last year's referendum crackdown.

The Mossos d'Esquadra, tryed to avoid the opposing groups from coming face-to-face. Around Via Laietana, right in the city center of the Catalan capital, as the Mossos tried to keep the pro-independence groups away from the Spanish agents. Police brutality is clear.

The Catalan independence referendum of 2017, also known by the numeronym 1-O (for ""1 October"") in Spanish media, was an independence referendum held on 1 October 2017 in the Spanish autonomous community of Catalonia, passed by the Parliament of Catalonia as the Law on the Referendum on Self-determination of Catalonia and called by the Generalitat de Catalunya. It was declared illegal on 7 September 2017 and suspended by the Constitutional Court of Spain after a request from the Spanish government, who declared it a breach of the Spanish Constitution.  Additionally, in early September the High Court of Justice of Catalonia had issued orders to the police to try to prevent it, including the detention of various persons responsible for its preparation. Due to alleged irregularities during the voting process as well as to the use of force by the National Police and Civil Guard, international observers invited by the Generalitat declared that the referendum failed to meet the minimum international standards for elections.

El referèndum sobre la independència de Catalunya (oficialment Referèndum d'Autodeterminació de Catalunya, conegut pel numerònim 1-O) és un referèndum d'autodeterminació vinculant que fou celebrat l'1 d'octubre de 2017.

Fou organitzat pel Govern de Catalunya, format després d'unes eleccions en les quals els partidaris del referèndum van obtenir la majoria en el Parlament de Catalunya. Tanmateix, el Govern d'Espanya s'hi oposà, d'acord amb la interpretació de les lleis i la Constitució del país en aquell moment. La seva convocatòria va ser oficialment suspesa pel Tribunal Constitucional d'Espanya l'endemà de l'aprovació, però el Govern català continuà la seva organització, basant-se en la Llei del referèndum d'autodeterminació de Catalunya, aprovada el 6 de setembre de 2017, el referèndum es convocà enmig d'un xoc de legalitats vigents. Més de dos milions de persones van votar i es van produir escenes de forta violència física per part dels cossos i forces de seguretat de l'Estat.

El referéndum de independencia de Cataluña de 2017 —también conocido por el numerónimo 1-O— fue un referéndum de autodeterminación convocado por el Gobierno de Cataluña, suspendido por el Tribunal Constitucional el 7 de septiembre de 2017​ y finalmente celebrado en la comunidad autónoma española de Cataluña el 1 de octubre de 2017.

La ley del Referéndum que lo haría posible, fue aprobada el 6 de septiembre por el Parlamento de Cataluña con los votos a favor de los parlamentarios de Junts pel Sí y la CUP, en un pleno rodeado de una fuerte polémica.​ Dicha ley establece que el referéndum es vinculante y que se proclamará la independencia dos días después de la publicación de los resultados oficiales si el ""sí"" obtiene más votos que el ""no"", sin requerir una participación mínima.​ Los partidos de la oposición se negaron a votar dicha ley, excepto Catalunya Sí que es Pot que se abstuvo.",Alex R.,"Police', 'surrounding', 'thousands', 'protesters', 'gathered', 'central', 'Barcelona', 'demand', 'independence', 'Catalonia', 'armed', 'colored', 'powder', 'Policemen', 'shields', 'batons', 'reported', 'policeman', 'brutally', 'beating', 'protester'",PT1M21S,81,Catalonia Independence,2

qxD9CIN5u_U,2017-10-08T05:17:33.000Z,UCHTK-2W11Vh1V4uwofOfR4w,Analyst on Catalonia's independence referendum,"(3 Oct 2017) A Spanish political expert said on Monday that the Spanish government had made a mistake in not reaching some kind of agreement with the Catalan government in advance of Sunday's controversial independence referendum.
Fernando Vallespin, Professor of political studies in Madrid's Autonomous University, pointed out that the Catalan government had wanted a popular vote and had convinced the Catalan population that it was the right move, but that in fact, the right thing would have been to ""keep the law."" 
Vallespin spoke as Catalan separatists called for international mediation with the Spanish government as they pushed ahead with plans to declare unilateral independence this week after a violent police crackdown scarred a disputed secession referendum.
The referendum debacle only deepened Spain's most serious political crisis since democratic rule was restored in 1978.
The violence on Sunday in the prosperous northeastern region left more than 890 civilians and 430 police injured when anti-riot squads moved into polling stations and dispersed voters.
Shocking videos and photos of police dragging people by the hair and kicking them were flashed around the globe, leading some European leaders to warn about any further escalation of violence.
Spain is now considering the possible implementation of Article 155 of the country's constitution, which allows the government to suspend, totally or partially, the self-government of any region if it disobeys its constitutional obligations or attacks the general interests of Spain. 
Catalonia would first be warned and if it didn't rectify, the measures decided upon would be put to the Senate for approval, a simple matter for Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy as his party has a majority. 
Vallespin believes Article 155 could take around a week to implement, although it would need to be negotiated with the opposition.
The referendum fiasco brought Spain and Catalonia closer to a potentially disastrous showdown as each side said Sunday's events proved them right.
Rajoy met on Monday with his conservative Popular Party members before seeking a parliamentary session to discuss how to confront Spain's most serious political crisis in decades. 
He also met with the leaders of the opposition Socialist and Citizens parties to discuss Spain's options, although no immediate consensus emerged.
Vallespin compared Sunday's ballot with the recent referendum for Scottish independence in the UK, but says the situation is fundamentally different because the UK, unlike Spain, has parliamentary sovereignty and no written constitution.
Catalan officials say an overwhelming majority of the 2.26 million who voted supported independence from Spain - they said 90 percent - but the central government in Madrid has repeatedly condemned the referendum as unconstitutional and invalid.
The Catalan president said the regional parliament will be asked to declare independence this week after final results are announced - and plenary sessions are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.

 People celebrate the independence declaration in Catalonia
 - Catalan parliament declares independence from Spain - Catalan parliament votes to start 'constituent process' to split from Spain - Catalans declare independence as Madrid imposes direct rule - 
 Catalan Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favor of declaring independence from Spain - Catalonia Passes Motion for Independence from Spain - Catalonia independence live updates - Catalonia live updates -  catalonia independence live -  Catalonia live webcam - katalonien unabhängigkeit live - katalonien unabhängigkeit von Spanien - Katalonien Regionalparlament stimmt für Unabhängigkeitserklärung - The Catalan Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favor of declaring independence from Spain on Friday, taking the country's deepening political crisis into uncharted territory.
The vote brought to a head a weeks-long standoff with Madrid that began with a disputed referendum on October 1, and came as the Spanish Senate approved the Madrid government's unprecedented plans to seize control of the autonomous region.
The Spanish government is now expected to begin moves at the weekend to remove from office the Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and his ministers, and impose direct rule from Madrid. Lawmakers voted in secret in the Catalan Parliament chamber after a heated debate on a motion ""to form the Catalan Republic as an independent and sovereign state.""
The outcome: 70 votes in favor, 10 against and two blanks. Opposition lawmakers walked out of the chamber ahead of the vote. Pro-independence crowds massed outside the Parliament cheered and waved the Catalan ""Estelada"" separatist flag as the result was announced. Within minutes, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy tweeted an appeal for calm. ""I ask all Spaniards to remain calm. The rule of law will restore legality in Catalonia,"" he said.
The two parliamentary sessions were the culmination of a weeks-long standoff, which began on October 1 when Catalonia defied Madrid and held a banned referendum on independence, plunging Spain into its worst political crisis since the restoration of democracy in the 1970s. Hopes for a resolution were dashed Thursday when Puigdemont backed away from a plan to call new elections himself, amid disagreement within his own party and pressure from opposing sides. Hopes for a resolution were dashed Thursday when Puigdemont backed away from a plan to call new elections himself, amid disagreement within his own party and pressure from opposing sides.
 Speaking in the Catalan Parliament building after the landmark vote, Puigdemont said legitimately elected lawmakers had cast their ballots according to a mandate earned in the October 1 referendum.
But he acknowledged that the path ahead would not be easy. ""We are facing a period in which we will need to stay strong and in peace, dignified and civil as we have always been, and I'm sure we will keep being so,"" he said.
""The institutions and the people together built nations, societies, and a nation cannot be built without one of these elements.""
Supporters followed his words with applause and repeated chants of ""freedom, freedom."" Source: CNN

No arrests or injuries were reported. Activists blocked roads and rail lines in Catalonia on Thursday as a region-wide strike began against the trial of separatist leaders for their role in a failed 2017 secession attempt. Called by a small pro-independence union, Intersindical CSC, but without the backing of larger unions, the one-day strike was not widely followed in the northeastern region although it generated several protests.

In the rally organised by the National Catalan Assembly, protesters demanded the release of jailed Catalan politicians, while in the organised by the far-right Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), the right to vote for Catalan's independence by its citizens was highlighted.

Unlike most independence days, Catalan National Day 'La Diada' celebrated on September 11, commemorates the fall of Barcelona to the troops of King Philip V of Spain after a 14-month siege in 1714.

SOT, Xavier, Protester (Catalan): ""For many years, we have been asking to express ourselves democratically to decide our future. We are in an EU country that does not let us vote to decide our future. We are here because our politicians and our government following our instructions put ballot boxes and the Spanish state remove them by the force, and for doing this, those people are in prison.""

SOT, Joseph, Protester (Catalan): ""I believe that the Republic will arrive. I think that we have to push more, it will take some more years.""

SOT, Rosa, Protester (Catalan): ""I think that we are not in a good situation. We know that it is not going to be a fair trial and they play with all advantages; I'm not optimistic. I think that there should not be any trial against them. There is no cause [for them] to be in court.""

E.U. Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson gives a defense of free trade practices and globalization.

-----

Europe and the U.S.: Confronting Global Challenges with Peter Mandelson.

In a speech at the Carnegie Endowment, EU Commissioner of Trade Peter Mandelson argued that the European Union and the United States must use their collective economic weight to underwrite the openness of the global economy as its adjusts to the rise of new economic powers and greater global flows of investment. Mandelson said that the U.S. and the EU should use their own openness to ""underwrite a strong multilateral order based on cooperation and economic openness"" - Carnegie Endowment for International Peace

Peter Mandelson was born in Britain in 1953.

He studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at St Catherine's College, Oxford. As a young man he lived in Tanzania for a year, an experience which formed life-long impressions of Africa and the challenges of fighting poverty. A life-long pro-European, he led the British delegation to the first ever meeting of the European Communities Youth Forum in Strasbourg in 1979.

After working as an economist at the Trades Union Congress and as a current affairs TV producer, Peter Mandelson was later appointed Labour Party Director for Campaigns and Communications in 1985. Later he was Tony Blairs Campaign Manager in the May 1997 election that brought Labour to power in Britain.

In 1992 he was elected as member of parliament for the Northern English constituency of Hartlepool. He served until 2004 upon his appointment to the European Commission.

Peter Mandelson is honorary Chair of Policy Network, a European and international think tank whose journal and conferences promote the exchange and debate of centre-left policy ideas and European social democratic thinking. He was UK chairman of the UK-Japan 21st Century Group, which brings together leading academics, politicians and business people. He has traveled widely and has lectured throughout Europe, in Asia and the United States.",FORA.tv,"globalisation', 'european', 'union', 'economics', 'economy', 'markets', 'practices', 'business', 'tariffs', 'mandleson', 'jobs', 'workers', 'eu', 'us', 'foratv', 'fora.tv', 'fora', 'tv'",PT5M51S,351,Free Trade,6

What does it take to transform a cultural identity into a nation-state? And what is the impact?

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.st/2zpWFnB 

The number of countries in the United Nations has grown over the decades – from 51 states in 1945 to 193 today. Many more places want to become independent.
 
But national governments almost always oppose secession.
Catalonia’s parliament declared independence from Spain in October 2017 following a referendum deemed illegal by the central authorities in Madrid.

Spain dismissed the region’s government, and decreed that a fresh election should be held. Catalan politicians leading the independence movement could be jailed for decades if found guilty of rebellion and sedition. 

The autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq also held a recent independence referendum. It outraged the government in Baghdad and neighbouring countries, which also have Kurdish minorities.

The Baghdad government claimed the independence referendum was illegal and seized back the lands Kurds had taken beyond their region. 

The desire for secession is nothing new.

There are estimated to be more than than 8000 ethno-cultural groups in the world. With many independence movements demanding that their homelands be recognised as countries. 

Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said that if every region had its way, the EU would become unmanageable. 

So who gets to form a state?

There are no clear international rules. The 1933 Montevideo Convention declared that a region needs 4 things to become a state:
- a permanent population
- a defined territory
- a government
- and the capacity to enter into relations with other states.

But these are only guidelines. Ideally a region would also meet other conditions, such as:
- show that a clear majority have freely chosen independence
- respect its own minorities
- have a viable state
- and settle terms with the state it leaves and its neighbours

In practice, all these conditions are hard to meet. 

Taiwan is a modern, democratic state in all but international law. 
It’s an island off the south-eastern coast of China which has its own constitution, functions as an independent state, has democratically elected leaders, and was the first place in Asia to rule in favour of gay marriage.

Per head it’s around three times richer than mainland China. But China regards Taiwan as a renegade province. It insists that no country can have diplomatic ties with both itself and Taiwan. Only 19 countries, plus the Vatican, officially recognise it.

Somaliland is another region seeking to be recognised as a country. The semi-desert territory on the coast of the Gulf of Aden declared independence from Somalia in 1991. It has its own government, police force and currency. But no foreign government recognises it. Perhaps for good reason.

To recognise Somaliland would encourage other separatists in the region. It would undermine the already-weak federal government of Somalia. And it would probably lead to war. 

There have only been two major changes to African borders since the 1960s and neither is a success story. 

Eritrea declared independence from Ethiopia in 1993. Today the country has a despotic government and its people are mired in abject poverty.

In 2011 South Sudan seceded from Sudan, making it the world’s newest country. Soon after South Sudan formed civil war broke out displacing 2.2 million people. Although a ceasefire was signed in 2015, the country lies in ruins - plagued by hyper-inflation, famine and violence.

Independence has a romantic ring. Many sympathise with the demand for freedom. But redrawing borders is dangerous, and often causes as many problems as it solves.

It seems millions of people claim to have been at Woodstock when only 500,000 or so were really there, but the biggest pop-culture event of the 1960s has nothing on one of the most pivotal of the 1970s: The Sex Pistols' appearance at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester, England, on June 4, 1976. Proportional to the actual crowd in attendance, perhaps no event in the history of pop music has enjoyed greater retroactive audience growth than the one that's been called ""The gig that changed the world.""
 
By June 1976, the Sex Pistols had been playing together under that name for only seven months, and though their look, their sound and their nihilistic attitude were already in place, they and the entire British punk scene were still a few months away from truly breaking out. They had drawn just enough attention in the British music press, though, to inspire two young men from Manchester named Howard DeVoto and Pete Shelley to go down and see them play in London in February. From this experience, two things happened: DeVoto and Shelley arranged for the Sex Pistols to come up north and play the Lesser Free Trade Hall; and then they formed their own new band, called the Buzzcocks. News of the June 4 gig in Manchester spread mostly by word of mouth, such that on the night of the show, perhaps as few as 40 people showed up in a room that could hold hundreds. In that small crowd, however, were some names that would help shape the course of pop music over the next decade:
 
Howard DeVoto and Pete Shelley: Their band, the Buzzcocks, would go on to enjoy enormous popularity and influence in the UK both during and after the punk era.
 
Ian Curtis, Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook: The very next day, Hook would buy his first guitar, and the three young Mancunians would become a band. That band—originally called the Stiff Kittens and later Warsaw—was Joy Division, one of the best-known and most influential of all the early New Wave bands.
 
Mark E. Smith: Following the Sex Pistols gig, he started The Fall, a post-punk band that never had a true hit record but influenced generations of followers from Nirvana to Franz Ferdinand.
 
Steven Patrick Morrissey: The last of these notables to make a name for himself, but one of the most successful, both as leader of The Smiths in the mid-1980s and as a solo artist thereafter.
 
Tony Wilson: Manchester TV news presenter who would be inspired to start the record label Factory Records, which would help create the thriving Manchester scene of the 1980s and early-90s.
 
Just a few days after the Sex Pistols stormed Manchester on this day in 1976, they returned to London for gigs on July 4 and 6 that featured two brand-new bands as opening acts: The Clash and The Damned. Three weeks after that, their return gig at the Lesser Free Trade Hall (featuring opening act the Buzzcocks) drew hundreds, as the punk era unofficially opened.",John Lydon,,PT3M4S,184,Free Trade,4

Read more here: http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/02/europe/catalonia-independence-referendum-explainer/index.html

“(CNN)Spain is facing political turmoil this week following a contested independence referendum in the region of Catalonia, which descended into violence and left hundreds injured.

More than 2.25 million people turned out to Sunday's referendum across Catalonia, a region in the northeast of Spain. The regional government said 90% of voters were in favor of a split from Madrid.

But the turnout was low -- around 42% of the voter roll. Catalan authorities blamed the figure on the crackdown on the vote initiated by the national government.

Spain's highest court had ruled the vote illegal under the Spanish constitution. Citing the judicial authority, Madrid flooded Catalonia with thousands of national police in advance of the vote. Officers seized millions of ballot papers and sealed schools and other buildings to be used as polling stations.

On Sunday, the day of the disputed vote, national police launched a concerted effort to prevent people from casting their ballots. Police fired rubber bullets at protesters and voters trying to take part in the referendum, and used batons to beat them back.”

http://www.osteopathie-france.net/essai/biblio/divers/1350-vaccination

Il y dénonce la vaccination pratiquée à outrance contre des maladies bénignes : la rougeole par exemple. Saviez-vous que la vaccination contre la rougeole n'a jamais permis l'éradication de la maladie, puisqu'elle avait déjà disparu bien avant la mise en place de la campagne de masse ? Saviez-vous que les Pays-Bas ont toujours refusé la vaccination BCG, et que l'épidémie de tuberculose y a diminué bien plus rapidement qu'en France, même en prenant en compte la différence du nombre d'habitants ?

Mais en plus de cela, la vaccination peut se révêler dangereuse. Déjà, parce que loin d'empêcher le vacciné de contracter la maladie, elle augmente ses chances de la contracter effectivement. Prenons actuellement une recrudescence de la rougeole chez les adultes particulièrement virulente ; c'est un effet secondaire du vaccin, qui n'a pas permis à une immunité naturelle de se former.

En Finlande, la poliomyélite n'existait plus depuis 20 ans, la vaccination généralisée a fait réintroduire 10 cas dans les années 1980, bien plus agressifs que la maladie normale. Là-bas, les autorités sanitaires moins soumises aux laboratoires ont fait retirer la vaccination anti-poliomyélite.

It stops them suffering from diseases that can be fatal. Vaccine side effects are one of the hot topics at the moment in both human and pet health. What are the real risks of vaccination in dogs and cats?

No, vaccines do not cause autism in dogs, cats or people. If you really believe a Dr who has been struck off for falsifying research data then I can't help you!

Vaccines do come with some risks however. Most are mild, nothing more than the body reacting to a perceived infection. There is though a very small chance of more serious side effects that you should be aware of such as anaphylactic reaction and injection site tumor.

It's important not to overexaggerate the risks of these though when the risk of not vaccinating is certainly much much greater for the vast majority of pet dogs and cats.

Here in America, as we reflect on the many things we have to be grateful for, we should take a moment to recognize that one of the key factors behind our nation's great prosperity is the open trade policy that allows the American people to freely exchange goods and services with free people around the world. The freedom to trade is not a new issue for America. In 1776 our Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence, charging the British with a number of offenses, among them, and I quote, ``cutting off our trade with all parts of the world,'' end quote.
 
And that same year, a Scottish economist named Adam Smith launched another revolution with a book entitled ``The Wealth of Nations,'' which exposed for all time the folly of protectionism. Over the past 200 years, not only has the argument against tariffs and trade barriers won nearly universal agreement among economists but it has also proven itself in the real world, where we have seen free-trading nations prosper while protectionist countries fall behind.
 
America's most recent experiment with protectionism was a disaster for the working men and women of this country. When Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley tariff in 1930, we were told that it would protect America from foreign competition and save jobs in this country -- the same line we hear today. The actual result was the Great Depression, the worst economic catastrophe in our history; one out of four Americans were thrown out of work. Two years later, when I cast my first ballot for President, I voted for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who opposed protectionism and called for the repeal of that disastrous tariff.
 
Ever since that time, the American people have stayed true to our heritage by rejecting the siren song of protectionism. In recent years, the trade deficit led some misguided politicians to call for protectionism, warning that otherwise we would lose jobs. But they were wrong again. In fact, the United States not only didn't lose jobs, we created more jobs than all the countries of Western Europe, Canada, and Japan combined. The record is clear that when America's total trade has increased, American jobs have also increased. And when our total trade has declined, so have the number of jobs.
 
Part of the difficulty in accepting the good news about trade is in our words. We too often talk about trade while using the vocabulary of war. In war, for one side to win, the other must lose. But commerce is not warfare. Trade is an economic alliance that benefits both countries. There are no losers, only winners. And trade helps strengthen the free world.
 
Yet today protectionism is being used by some American politicians as a cheap form of nationalism, a fig leaf for those unwilling to maintain America's military strength and who lack the resolve to stand up to real enemies -- countries that would use violence against us or our allies. Our peaceful trading partners are not our enemies; they are our allies. We should beware of the demagogs who are ready to declare a trade war against our friends -- weakening our economy, our national security, and the entire free world -- all while cynically waving the American flag. The expansion of the international economy is not a foreign invasion; it is an American triumph, one we worked hard to achieve, and something central to our vision of a peaceful and prosperous world of freedom.
 
After the Second World War, America led the way to dismantle trade barriers and create a world trading system that set the stage for decades of unparalleled economic growth. And in one week, when important multilateral trade talks are held in Montreal, we will be in the forefront of efforts to improve this system. We want to open more markets for our products, to see to it that all nations play by the rules, and to seek improvement in such areas as dispute resolution and agriculture. We also want to bring the benefits of free trade to new areas, including services, investment, and the protection of intellectual property. Our negotiators will be working hard for all of us.
 
Yes, back in 1776, our Founding Fathers believed that free trade was worth fighting for. And we can celebrate their victory because today trade is at the core of the alliance that secure the peace and guarantee our freedom; it is the source of our prosperity and the path to an even brighter future for America.
 
Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

""We have a very open way of seeing the world. For many years the Catalan culture was undermined, I feel that if we do not fight for it, that will happen again, we will lose our way of seeing the world.""
  
The views of two young people who are members of a band rehearsing for a concert to promote independence for Catalonia.

  
It's a theme that brought a million and a half people on to the streets of Barcelona, ​​the capital of the autonomous region of Spain, during the Diada, the National Day of Catalonia last September.
  
Initiatives are springing up everywhere in the separatist region. The village of Sant Pere de Torello, became famous by declaring itself an independent Catalan territory.

The pediment of the town hall has for a year and a half been flying the Catalan independence flag, but not the Spanish one.


""Currently, there are 180 town halls that have the flag of independence flying permanently from their balconies,"" explained the mayor of the village, Jordi Fabrega Colome.

Separatists decry the state system of fiscal redistribution, including public spending in Catalonia which is well below the taxes they pay.
  
""We live in a state of national emergency, with an unemployment rate of 22.5 percent of the population here. Catalonia pays 16 billion euros annually to the state, which does not amount to any form of services or investment in Catalonia. We have to have this showdown with the Spanish government,"" added the mayor of the village.
  
Catalonia is among the richest regions in Spain, and it pays the equivalent of eight percent of GDP to the state.
   
It is also one of the most indebted. Failure to negotiate an agreement with the Spanish government to give Catalonia fiscal sovereignty, has led the president of the Regional Government, Artur Mas, to call for early elections and a referendum on independence.
  
That would require reform of the Spanish Constitution, which does not permit independence,  and of course steps to obtain international recognition.


""If Catalonia gets independence, it will be a state outside the European Union, and will have to apply for entry into the EU. To gain admission, provided that no member state objects, will require a very long process,"" points out Francesc de Carreras Serra, Professor of constitutional law at the Autonomous University of Catalonia. Economist Oriol Amat believes it is a theoretical question.
  
""I can't imagine that the EU wants to keep out a state that brings money into the European Union and is very pro European Union and in which the EU has invested heavily in the past.""
  
It's a question which not least concerns some Catalan businesses who fear the effect of a possible exit from the euro, and especially a deterioration in trade relations with Spain.
  
Some large companies have threatened to move their headquarters from Barcelona, ​​if there was independence. None of those euronews contacted agreed to talk. Only this small publisher opened the door to us.  

Javier Baratech, general manager Rondas  said, ""About 80 percent of the billing and the company's sales are in the rest of Spain. We would at least in the short term lose all those customers, and that would very quickly force the business to close. Trading outside Spain, and the European Union, our products would be taxed. Moreover, our customers tell us that if Catalonia became independent, they would look for other suppliers, in their own country.""
  
One family business is not concerned about economic nationalism. The company is riding on the wave of independence. Its, ""signature"" product is the Catalan flag of independence.

""We have seen a fairly strong increase in sales. Every year, we produce large stocks, but this year was a record. There are people who were queuing outside the company to buy the independence flag,"" Laura Fenoy the General Manager of Estampser told euronews.
  
Beyond niche markets,  will the Catalan, ""label""   be able to cope with the political uncertainties which generate the debate on independence?

Tourism, a pillar of the Catalan economy, fears neither boycott nor the loss of capital as Marian Muro i Ollé, Director General for tourism explained.

Almost two million people according to local police gathered in Barcelona on Thursday to celebrate the Catalonian national day and to demand a referendum for the independence of Catalonia. 

Demonstrators marched through Diagonal Street and Gran Via, converging to form the letter ""V"" for ""vote"" and ""victory"". Protesters also waved pro-independence flags and shouted ""we want to vote"" and ""independence"". 

Many personalities addressed the crowds from three different stages along the march. Demonstrators explained that they did not feel Spanish and merely viewed Spain as a neighbour but not as part of their national and cultural identity.

THaeCH-HX4w,2017-09-01T07:00:02.000Z,UCDg53Em9AHmMlpdlL9j7svw,"Vaccination, les vérités indésirables","Michel Georget nous livre le résultat de ses recherches sur la vaccination, le danger de certains vaccins et les dérives des laboratoires pharmaceutiques. Son livre: http://amzn.to/2uGO4H1.

Il explique qu'un vaccin est destiné à stimuler une première réponse du système immunitaire avec un pathogène (virus, bactérie) inactivé ou diminué afin que celui-ci soit en mesure de se protéger une fois que l'individu rentrera en contact avec la maladie.

Les 3 vaccins obligatoires sont ceux de la Dyphtérie, de la Polio et du Tétanos. Mais le vaccin DTP (ou DT-Polio) réunissant les 3 vaccins n'est plus fabriqué par les laboratoires sous prétexte qu'il provoquait des allergies. On a ainsi ajouté la Coqueluche puis l'Haemophilus (méningites) et enfin l'Hépatite B aux 3 vaccins obligatoires pour en faire un vaccin hexavalent (vaccin à 6 valences). C'est pour Michel Georget une manipulation financière car les vaccins hexavalents sont jusqu'à 7 fois plus chers. De plus, refaire un vaccin tétravalent moins cher ne serait pas rentable pour l'industrie pharmaceutique.

Pour Michel Georget, cela amène la question du calendrier vaccinal et la charge de vaccins bien trop importante pour le corps des enfants, encore en développement. 92 stimulations avec les rappels pour les garçons et jusqu'à 110 pour les filles selon Michel Georget! Son livre '""Vaccinations, les vérités indésirables': http://amzn.to/2uGO4H1. 

Selon Michel Georget il y a aussi un problème de rigueur scientifique car il n'y a pas d'étude pharmacocinétique, c'est à dire qu'on ne sait pas ce que deviennent dans notre corps les produits injectés ! Alors que pour tout médicament mis sur le marché, des études rigoureuses sont obligatoires. Or, pour Michel Georget, cela permettrait de voir que l'aluminium contenu dans certains vaccins se fixe parfois dans des endroits indésirables (cerveau, muscles,etc.) et devient responsable de certaines maladies comme la myofasciite à macrophages.

Le vaccin le plus dangereux était celui contre la variole, suivi à présent de la valence de la Coqueluche et celle de l'Hépatite B. Mais également la conjonction des vaccinations, car certains pédiatres font sur un enfant d'un côté le vaccin hexavalent et de l'autre le vaccin Pneumocoque (Prevenar 13), dans la même séance ! Ce qui constitue pour Michel Georget une surcharge certaine pour l'organisme des enfants et peut conduire à une réaction inflammatoire brutale pouvant conduire à la mort.

Michel Georget regrette également que la mort d'un enfant à Barcelone de la dyphtérie, et celle d'un autre enfant de la rougeole à Berlin aientt complètement éclipsé la mort de 3 nourrissons suite à l'injection simultané de l'hexavalent et du prévenar.

Enfin, il pense que nos fonctions biologiques peuvent à terme être atteintes par ces surcharges vaccinales. Pour preuve l'augmentation considérable des réactions allergiques, des allergies d'une part et une augmentation des maladies auto-immunes d'autre part, notamment celle que l'on ne trouvait avant que chez les adultes mais maintenant présentes chez les enfants dès 3 ou 4 ans.


Son livre '""Vaccinations, les vérités indésirables': http://amzn.to/2uGO4H1. La qualité première de ce livre est de nous rendre lucides. L'auteur éclaire de façon incontestable certaines zones obscures de ce qui touche, en nous, l'essentiel : notre santé. Nous devrions tous lire cet ouvrage. À plus forte raison si nous avons des enfants. Mais aussi pour nous-mêmes, afin de pouvoir juger de l'opportunité de les accepter ou de les refuser et, pour les vaccinations obligatoires, obtenir la liberté totale de choix comme c'est le cas dans la plupart des pays européens.

The move was was backed 70-10 in a ballot boycotted by opposition MPs.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy earlier told senators direct rule was needed to return ""law, democracy and stability"" to Catalonia.
The crisis began when Catalans backed independence in a disputed vote earlier this month.
The Catalan government said that of the 43% who took part in the referendum, 90% were in favour of independence. But Spain's Constitutional Court had ruled the vote illegal.
Spain's Senate is still to vote on whether for the first time to enact Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, which empowers the government to take ""all measures necessary to compel"" a region in case of a crisis.
It would enable Madrid to fire Catalan leaders, and take control of the region's finances, police and public media.

More than 800 people were injured after Spanish police stormed polling stations and tried to forcibly prevent people from voting, firing tear gas and physically attacking prospective voters. Late on Sunday night, the Catalan regional government said 90 percent of Catalan voters chose independence. The Catalan government now says it plans to unilaterally declare independence from Spain within 48 hours. Spain says it will recognize neither the results of the referendum nor a declaration of independence. The escalating conflict is being described as the biggest constitutional crisis in Spain since the end of the Franco dictatorship in the 1970s. For more, we speak with Sebastiaan Faber, professor of Hispanic studies at Oberlin College and author of the forthcoming book ""Memory Battles of the Spanish Civil War: History, Fiction, Photography."" He’s the co-author of an article in The Nation headlined ""Have Spain and Catalonia Reached a Point of No Return?"" We also speak with Pau Faus, filmmaker and writer from Barcelona, Spain. His recent documentary ""Ada for Mayor"" follows the campaign of Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau.

Health & Medicine on Khan Academy: No organ quite symbolizes love like the heart. One reason may be that your heart helps you live, by moving ~5 liters (1.3 gallons) of blood through almost 100,000 kilometers (62,000 miles) of blood vessels every single minute! It has to do this all day, everyday, without ever taking a vacation! Now that is true love. Learn about how the heart works, how blood flows through the heart, where the blood goes after it leaves the heart, and what your heart is doing when it makes the sound “Lub Dub.”

Put football rivalry jokes aside: the escalation between Barcelona and Madrid is serious.
A sea of independence supporters turning out Monday in Barcelona to support a second attempt at an independence referendum. We'll gauge support within Catalonia for a break-off from Spain. And like the one in 2014, the courts in Madrid have already forbidden the October 1st vote. This time, they've gone further, with court summons and the threat of arrest warrants for mayors who take part in the vote.

This follows a referendum Sunday in which 90% of Catalans voted in favor of breaking away from Spain – although less than half of those registered turned out to vote. Madrid has declared the vote illegal, and Spain’s King has also strongly criticized the Catalan government – raising the stakes yet further in a crisis that has caught Europe by surprise.

With vaccines, we take advantage of one of the most important aspects of the immune system - the ability to develop immunological memory. This means, that once the person or animal is exposed to a particular pathogen, in other words anything that can cause an illness, they will develop resistance to infection with the same pathogen in the future.

By taking advantage of immunological memory, vaccination prevents and controls the spread of a wide range of illnesses, including polio, smallpox, whooping cough, measles and the seasonal influenza virus.

uQAT9S5n344,2018-01-13T13:42:17.000Z,UCHTK-2W11Vh1V4uwofOfR4w,Kurds reflect on Kurdish and Catalan independence push,"(8 Jan 2018) LEADIN:
Kurds living in Catalonia have been reflecting on the duel independence referendums held last year.
Both the Spanish region and the northern Kurdish region of Iraq held votes on secession - both triggering serious diplomatic rifts.
STORYLINE:
A place with a strong independence movement that held a controversial referendum last year. Sound familiar? But this is Barcelona, not Irbil.
Just like the northern Kurdish region of Iraq, voters went to polls in Catalonia to have their say on independence.
And just like the Kurds, the October 2017 ballot has caused a diplomatic rift with central government.
A few hundred Kurds live in this region of Spain, according to unofficial figures from the local Middle East community.
Enwer Hama, a Kurdish mechanical engineer from Sulaymaniyah, has lived in Barcelona for eight years.
He thinks the strong showing for pro-independence parties in December's regional elections shows the movement is gaining momentum here.
The pro-secession parties won 70 out of the regional parliament's 135 seats .
""This new election (on December 21st) confirmed that there is a tendency for more auto (self) -governing in Catalonia. And I believe this will end up positive for the Catalan people,"" he says. 
""But up to now it was very bad consequences for the southern Kurdistan.""
He believes their similar experiences mean people here ""understand the Kurdish cause more easily"" than other Europeans.
Both the Catalan and the Kurdish referendums came out in favour of independence.
But the Catalan vote was deemed illegal and several members of Catalonia's pro-secession regional cabinet were fired and jailed for their roles in the drive for independence.
Other members of the Catalonia government, including ex-leader Carles Puigdemont, are fugitives in Brussels.
And in Iraq, September's landslide victory for independence has not achieved its goal.
Instead, the Iraqi military advanced into disputed areas and took back control from the Kurdish Peshmerga. 
The Iraqi central government also imposed a ban on international flights into the region and some countries closed border crossings.
Iraqi Assyrian Pius Alibek has watched events unfold in both countries.
""What hurts me from all of this is the disappointment that all Kurds went through after voting 'yes' full of excitement. And also the disappointment that all Catalans went through after hoping they would vote in freedom,"" he says.
He doesn't believe either the Kurds or the Catalans will achieve independence, because those in power will also stop it from happening.
In the popular neighbourhood of Gotic, a group of Kurds from southeast Turkey gather for a lively chat about politics in a Middle Eastern restaurant.
The owner, Ismet Turk Yilmaz, a 53 year-old from Adiyaman, says he was very excited and closely following the two referendums in September and October, but that his hopes were dashed.
""Disappointed in Catalonia because in the beginning Spain looks more democratic than Iraq. But in this case Iraq was more democratically (democratic) than Spain,"" he says.
His friend Zana Suphandagi, a former political activist from Agri, who has been living in Europe for about 22 years, says the Spanish government's response was shocking.
More than 800 people were injured as riot police attacked peaceful protesters and unarmed civilians trying to cast their ballots.
""I didn't expect the Spanish state to react so harshly. If this is happening in the European Union, this is a shame for democracy.""

In response, Mr Johnson said it would be similar to Switzerland’s relationship with the European Union.

Switzerland is not part of the EU however it has signed up to a plethora of agreements and directives including free movement of people.

“There are examples of just-in-time supply chains that operate with a high-degree of efficiency over customs union differentials – there is no reason why that can’t be done”, he said.

“That should not be an obstacle to us properly taking back control, delivering what the British people voted for and doing great free-trade deals and seizing back control of our destiny.”

“The Chequers proposals manifestly fail to do that”, Mr Johnson added.

China is among the world’s fastest developing countries and much of its success is rooted in a unique brand of socialism, which encourages a market economy allowing private business to flourish within a state-dominated system. State owned businesses and self-starting entrepreneurs are enjoying new opportunities for international growth as the nation embarks on a mission to revive the ancient Silk Road trade routes.

Keep in mind that, as the note states in the video, a woman may be vaccinated against rubella as a child but find out when pregnant that she has a ""low titer"" of Rubella antibodies and therefore be vulnerable. As the note mentions, some vaccines require ""booster"" doses.

uXJXClLTqfA,2018-10-02T07:37:33.000Z,UCY2mhw-XNZSxrUynsI5K8Zw,Javier Marías Interview: On Catalonian Independence,"“Their position is almost a fascist position, and if I was Catalan, I would be very frightened by these people wanting to make a Catalan state,” says one of Spain’s most celebrated and acclaimed writers, Javier Marías, who here speaks openly of the Catalan independence movement. 

Something similar wouldn’t be allowed in other democratic European countries, Marías argues: “They have a constitution prohibiting parties openly wanting to divide the country or wanting to separate from the country.” This, he finds, is also proof that present-day Spain is a true democracy and doesn’t bear similarities to Franco’s regime, as the Catalan movement suggest: “They are the Spanish state in Catalonia. It’s ridiculous because they have rebelled against exactly what allows them to exist.” Moreover, though Marías – who is not “a great fan of my country” – understands the desire to separate from Spain, he doesn’t think that it should be with these people: “I wouldn’t like to be one of their subjects. Because they would be subjects, I’m sure of that. Not citizens, subjects.”

Javier Marías (b. 1951) is one of Spain’s most celebrated novelists, whose has been translated into numerous languages. He was born in Madrid, but – during the Franco regime – he spent parts of his childhood in the U.S., where his father taught at higher education institutions. Among his novels are ‘All Souls’ (1992) (Todas las almas, 1989), ‘A Heart So White’ (2012) (Corazón tan blanco, 1992), ‘The Infatuations’ (2013) (Los enamoramientos, 2011), ‘Berta Isla’ (2018) (Berta Isla, 2017) as well as the ‘Your Face Tomorrow’ trilogy (2004-2009) (Tu rostro manana, 2002-2007), which was hailed by the Guardian as “the first authentic literary masterpiece in the 21st century.” Marías is the recipient of prestigious awards such as the International Dublin Literary Award (1997) and the Prix Formentor (2013). Marías is also a columnist for El País as well as a respected translator of e.g. Shakespeare, Henry James, and Nabokov. Moreover, he operates the small publishing house Reino de Redonda. 

Javier Marías was interviewed by Synne Rifbjerg at the Louisiana Literature festival at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark in August 2018.

In Europe, most people follow the recommended vaccination schedules. But outbreaks of measles, pertussis, rubella and other vaccine-preventable diseases continue. 
This is because almost everyone needs to be immunised in order to control the spread of infectious diseases, and protect those who are too young or too sick to be vaccinated. 
Take measles, for example. The WHO says that for measles to be eliminated, 95% of children must have two doses of the MMR vaccine. 
This means that even if most people are vaccinated, the disease can persist in the community if the target vaccination rate of 95% is not reached.

Catalonia continues calls for independence 
01 March, 2010, 08:29
Catalonias unofficial polls have shown the Spanish region is strongly in favor of separation. But as calls for a referendum on independence continue, the issue seems far more complicated. 
Catalonias political struggle for independence is centuries-old. The prosperous province of seven million people already has enough national symbols, its own language, world-renowned architecture and an iconic football team, worshipped by fans worldwide.
Spain ignores our right to self-determination, explains a local Catalan. They restrict our language and culture, at least at an official level.
But the question Catalonia is facing is whether or not its quest for independence is more than just a game and it is indeed capable of becoming a viable state.
Local nationalists have staged several unofficial independence polls across some parts of Catalonia.
Each one has resulted in an overwhelming yes vote, though with small turn-outs. But the national government in Madrid has dismissed the results.
If people vote for independence, we will get independence, says Alfons Lopez Tena, a referendum organizer. We are fighting peacefully for democracy to make sure that the people's will can overcome the obstacles of the Spanish government.
Spanish laws passed four years ago already give Catalonia's local parliament the power to raise taxes, along with other responsibilities. Opponents of the law are challenging it in Spain's Supreme Court, saying it goes too far.
But some Catalonians take a radically different view.
We contribute billions of Euros to the government in Spain, we want to manage our own economy, says a Catalan resident. And without them we'd manage it better.
However, while it is the separatists who seem to speak loudest, the Catalan desire for full independence is not clear-cut. Official surveys suggest that in fact no more than one in five Catalans support it.
The economic justification for splitting from Spain is also being questioned.
Whenever people speak about Catalonia they mention its economic wealth. But the economic and social cost of setting up independent institutions would be formidable. For example, Catalonia doesn't have its own judicial system or army, says Montserrat Nebrera, Professor of Constitutional Law and Politicians
Independence for any Spanish region is not possible without major changes to the country's constitution, and Madrid remains staunchly opposed to separatism. Thus, it appears that despite vehement calls, any redrawing of maps may take a long time to achieve.

Momentum is growing in the Spanish region of Catalonia for an official referendum on independence. Catalonians say they should become another EU state as they have their own language and national symbols. So far unofficial polls have been overwhelmingly in favour of separation, which the Spanish government has dismissed as RT's Igor Ogorodnev reports.",cctvupload,"RT', 'separatism', 'Spain', 'Barcelona', 'Spanish', 'constitution', 'referendum', 'Igor', 'Ogorodnev'",PT3M21S,201,Catalonia Independence,4

It is important to note that I use Jocelyn Blink and Ian Dorton's ""IB Economics Course Companion"" as the primary text in class.  As a result, many of these videos use this text as source material.  I have found it to be an excellent resource for students.  Another source you may find helpful is Jason Welker’s site www.econclassroom.com.  Welker’s site and course companions are excellent and have served as another source for these videos.  Thank you Jocelyn, Ian, and Jason.

I hope you find these videos helpful to your study of IB Economics and please let me know if you have any suggestions to improve them.  

Enjoy!

Wouldn't it be great if public policies benefited the public, so everyone could prosper, and so-called ""free trade agreements"" valued our precious resources rather than exploiting people and the planet? As consumers, we have the power to vote with our dollars, as well as to engage in local and federal policy reform in order to help change and transform our global economy to protect our people and planet. In January 2014, the Camp-Baucus ""Fast Track"" legislation was introduced, that would have allowed President Obama to vote on free trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Trans-Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (TAFTA) without a full and open debate. This was concerning not only because such an arrangement is an affront to democracy, but also because the specific provisions in these agreements are expected to have negative impacts on farmers, workers, consumers, the environment, and public health world-wide and more time and care is needed to create trade policies that work for people.",Fair World Project,"Fair Trade (Symbolized Concept)', 'Free Trade (Idea)', ""Farmers' Market (Industry)"", 'farms', 'food', 'clean food', 'Trade (Organization Type)'",PT6M13S,373,Free Trade,7

I've made this video in collaboration with Public Health England to support the NHS and all of its hard working amazing staff this winter. 

Flu leads to hundreds of thousands of GP visits and tens of thousands of hospital stays a year. In the UK an average of 8,000 people die per year from complications of flu. Last year flu killed 15,000 people and the year before that it was 16,000 people.

Apart from protecting individual people, getting the flu vaccine helps to reduce the spread of the disease, and so reduces the chance of passing on the flu virus to other people who may be at risk of flu.

If you are eligible for the free NHS flu vaccine, let's play our part and get vaccinated to support the NHS and all of its hard working amazing staff this winter. Help spread the word to friends and family by sharing this video.

WHAT IS FLU:
Flu (influenza) is a common infectious viral illness spread by coughs and sneezes. For healthy adults under the age of 65 it can be very unpleasant,  you begin to feel better within about a week.

You can catch flu all year round, but it's especially common in winter, which is why it's also known as seasonal flu.

Some of the main symptoms of flu include:

• High temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
• Extreme tiredness and weakness
• Headache
• General aches and pains
• Dry, chesty cough
• Cold-like symptoms

Flu can make you feel so exhausted and unwell that you have to stay in bed and rest until you feel better.

WHO SHOULD GET THE FLU VACCINE:
Flu can lead to serious complications and death, especially for people in risk groups. In rare cases flu can kill people who are otherwise healthy.

In the UK the NHS flu vaccine is available each year from late September or early October onwards. If you are in the risk group It is recommended to get the flu vaccine in the autumn, before outbreaks of flu have started. It takes up to two weeks after vaccination for you to be protected against flu.

The inactivated flu vaccine does not contain any live flu viruses and cannot give you flu. In the 2018-19 season, two different types of inactivated flu vaccine will be offered in the UK.

• Those aged 65 or over will be offered a trivalent flu vaccine (protecting against three strains of flu virus) which also contains an adjuvant.
• Those aged under 64 years in eligible groups will be offered a quadrivalent flu vaccine (protecting against four strains of flu virus).

WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE FREE NHS FLU VACCINE:
• Children aged 2 and 3
• Children in reception class and school years 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
• Children aged 2 to 17 years at risk of flu
• Anyone aged 65 and over
• Pregnant women
• Children and adults with an underlying health condition (such as long-term heart or respiratory disease)
• Children and adults with weakened immune systems

Please click the following link to see the full list of those eligible for the free NHS flu vaccine: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/who-should-have-flu-vaccine/

WHERE CAN YOU GET THE FREE NHS FLU VACCINE
• Your local pharmacy
• Your GP surgery
• Your midwifery service if they offer it for pregnant women
• Most children will be offered the flu vaccine at school: For more information please visit: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/child-flu-vaccine/

National and Catalonia Flag History

How did flags come to be? Flag-like symbols have been in existence since the ancient times. It is not clear though where the Barcelona flags that we know today originated. Some say they originated in China, others believe that the first true flag was the vexillum of the Roman Empire, while some insist that there have been citations flags in the Mahabharata. While there is no unified origin, the modern-day flag surely had started sometime in the 18th century. Flags have then been used as signals and symbols for battle, military, and maritime purposes, among a few others. Even today, flags are continually used for a wide variety of purposes.

Most Popular video Flags Around the Catalonia

Another popular Barcelona flag is that of Catalan in white with the red rising sun in the middle? France's tricolor, Catalan red with five yellow stars, and Catalonia's black, red and gold bands are among the most popular flags as well. Some national flags have even been inspirational design-wise to other countries, nations and sub-national entities.

America consumes billions of dollars of apparel every year. Chances are, your apparel of choice wasn’t made in the United States, but thousands of miles away in countries such as China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh.

Over the last few decades, fashion has become a global industry, affecting manufacturers, workers, retailers, and consumers alike. While your choice of fashion may appear to be superficial, the questions surrounding the industry deal with important political, economic, and moral issues.

How is fashion affected by trade policies? Are tariffs effective in promoting domestic industry? Do free trade agreements help those who take part in them? Lawyers, law professors, and industry experts explore the complicated issues surrounding the apparel industry.

The vote came just before the Spanish national Senate voted in favour of invoking Article 155. The measure was activated by Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Saturday, and would allow Madrid to establish de facto direct rule over Catalonia.

It created a free trade area of 1.6 billion people in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The seven foreign ministers of the region signed a framework agreement on SAFTA to reduce customs duties of all traded goods to zero by the year 2016.
The SAFTA agreement came into force on 1 January 2006 and is operational following the ratification of the agreement by the seven governments. SAFTA requires the developing countries in South Asia to bring their duties down to 20 percent in the first phase of the two-year period ending in 2007. In the final five-year phase ending 2012, the 20 percent duty will be reduced to zero in a series of annual cuts. The least developed nations in South Asia have an additional three years to reduce tariffs to zero. India and Pakistan ratified the treaty in 2009, whereas Afghanistan as the 8th memberstate of the SAARC ratified the SAFTA protocol on the 4th of May 2011.

The march was the largest pro-union showing since the rise of separatist sentiment in the prosperous northeastern region that has pushed Spain to the brink of a national crisis.
Barcelona police said 350,000 people participated, while march organisers Societat Civil Catalana said that 930,000 people turned out.
Those numbers resemble the pro-independence rallies that Barcelona has seen in recent years.

National and Catalonia Flag History

How did flags come to be? Flag-like symbols have been in existence since the ancient times. It is not clear though where the Barcelona flags that we know today originated. Some say they originated in China, others believe that the first true flag was the vexillum of the Roman Empire, while some insist that there have been citations flags in the Mahabharata. While there is no unified origin, the modern-day flag surely had started sometime in the 18th century. Flags have then been used as signals and symbols for battle, military, and maritime purposes, among a few others. Even today, flags are continually used for a wide variety of purposes.

Most Popular video Flags Around the Catalonia 

It is true that some flags are more popular than others. Who would not know the American flag, also known as The Stars and Stripes? Another popular Barcelona flag is that of Catalan in white with the red rising sun in the middle? France's tricolor, Catalan red with five yellow stars, and Catalonia's black, red and gold bands are among the most popular flags as well. Some national flags have even been inspirational design-wise to other countries, nations and sub-national entities.

TRANSCRIPT:
Deirdre M.:
You can't get a better deal than, more or less, free trade. That's where we've moved. I mean, after the war every country was protectionist. There were no free trade countries. Even the old free trade company Britain had long since 30 years before become a protectionist country.
 Since then, we've been moving steadily towards free trade and it's been very good for the poor of the world. This idea that the poor made worse off by free trade is just lunacy.

Dave Rubin:
Interesting.

Deirdre M.:
It's a wage per what you can get with the wage is the key point. What you can get with a wage has steadily increased even though you've heard people say, ""Oh, things are getting worse."" No, they're not.

Dave Rubin:
Yeah.

Deirdre M.:
The sky is not falling. Manufacturing jobs in the United States peaked in 1977. They've been going down ever since. Why? Is it because of China, Mexico? Not much. That's maybe 10% of the loss jobs. The jobs are being lost either to other Americans moving to California or Texas, especially in Texas, or to automation. Just as you said the store, the bricks-and-mortar store for Amazon has no people in it.

Dave Rubin:
Yeah.

Deirdre M.:
Well, that's what's happening and that's a good thing not a bad thing. The purpose of the economy is not to make jobs. Jobs are infinite. We can make construction workers use teaspoons instead of shovels and that will make for more jobs.

Dave Rubin:
Right.

Deirdre M.:
The purpose of an economy is to get more goods and services, so that we have the leisure to pursue our hobbies and to educate ourselves. Suppose we just cut off foreign trade entirely. I know that's not his proposal, but suppose we just walled off the United States. Well then, every American would be poor, every single American.

xyPYAYDoeMI,2018-09-11T15:14:50.000Z,UCHTK-2W11Vh1V4uwofOfR4w,Yellow ribbon source of contention in Catalonia independence battle,"(5 Sep 2018) A twisted strip of yellow plastic has become a key bone of contention between Catalonia's separatists and those who want to protect the integrity of Spain.
Across the region, yellow ribbons are tied to benches, traffic posts and trash cans — or painted on sidewalks, tree trunks and lamp posts.
The yellow ribbon is a symbol of protest at the imprisonment of nine high-profile separatist leaders while they await trial on charges that include rebellion, for their role in an illegal referendum and ineffective declaration of independence last year.
But the littering of town squares, bridges and streets with the yellow ribbons has given life to a counter movement drawn from the other half of Catalonia's 7.5 million residents — the ones who want to maintain centuries-old ties with the rest of Spain.
Jose Casado is the spokesman for a loosely knit network of self-proclaimed ""cleaning brigades."" They are volunteers who meet a few times a month to scour their neighborhoods and remove as many of the yellow ribbons as they can find on public property. 
They use box cutters and tree pruners to snip off the ribbons, but have a rule not to touch the pro-independence flags and banners that hang from the balconies of private homes.
""Firstly we don't believe that they are political prisoners,"" Casado, a 38-year-old boxing instructor from the coastal town of Mataro, told the AP. ""Because they tried to do a coup d'état in Catalonia. In fact, there has been a social fracture since that day"" Casado added, referring to the referendum held on October 1. 
The cleaners do their work at night, wearing full white body suits and covering their faces with hygienic masks and protective goggles, partly to conceal their identity and partly to make a statement.
Casado and other four volunteers estimate that in the first hour of work on a recent night they removed well over one thousand ribbons from part of a fence running along the coastal train tracks of a small village near Barcelona. 
Divided by ideology, the two sides nonetheless resemble one another; both groups have sprung up over the past year on a local level, driven by social media and mobile-phone messaging services.
They also share a deep sense of aggrievement — the separatists feel abused by the central government and courts; the unionists feel demonized by the regional Catalan authorities.
The cleaning brigades argue that they are filling a gap left by Catalan authorities who have allowed the supporters of secession to turn common space into an echo chamber for their ideas.
Many secessionists pin the yellow symbol on their clothes and balconies and large yellow ribbons hang from both the seat of the Catalan government and the Barcelona town hall that face one another in the center of the region's capital.
So far, ugly run-ins between adversaries have mostly produced heated debates and the exchange of verbal insults. But three people were hurt in a clash last May in the coastal town of Canet de Mar when Casado's group tried to remove a bunch of yellow crosses that pro-secession activists had planted on the beach. Both sides blamed the other for the scuffle.
Also, last month a woman filed charges with the police claiming she was hit by a man who was angry at her for removing yellow ribbons in Barcelona.
Citing these statements by Torra and other evidence, Spain's state prosecutor's office has opened a probe into the alleged identification by Catalan police of people who have removed ribbons.

The Democrat-led Senate and Assembly voted Thursday to repeal the exemption, which allows parents of children to cite their religious beliefs to opt a child out of the vaccines required for school enrollment.

Soon after, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed the measure.

Similar exemptions are allowed in 46 states, though lawmakers in several of them are also considering the elimination of the waiver.

""We are facing an unprecedented public health crisis,"" said Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan and the sponsor of the legislation in the Senate. ""The atrocious peddlers of junk science and fraudulent medicine who we know as anti-vaxxers have spent years sowing unwarranted doubt and fear, but it is time for legislators to confront them head on.""

Hundreds of parents of unvaccinated children gathered at New York's Capitol before the vote to protest what several called an assault on religious freedom.

The US has been measles-free for 15 years but there has been a new outbreak, which started at Disneyland in California. The theme park has been praised for its handling of the outbreak, which may have been triggered by an overseas visitor. The spread of cases across seven states and Mexico is being blamed on parents who have chosen not to give their children the MMR vaccine, due to concerns about potential side effects. No authoritative research has been published to back up claims that the vaccine may be linked to autism and bowel disease.
Alistair Leithead reports from Orange County in California.

A peer-to-peer network for selling goods online, OpenBazaar runs on open source software that users download and install on their computers, which is similar to a BitTorrent client. The client connects them to the OpenBazaar network, where they can trade with other users. It's like eBay without eBay. All items are paid for using bitcoin.

""OpenBazaar doesn't have a central point of failure,"" explains OB-1 co-founder Sam Patterson. ""Everyone using it is a node in a completely distributed network. If you take one user off the network, it has no impact on any of the other users.""

Last year, OB1, the company that's developing the OpenBazaar network, got a million dollars in venture capital from Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and investor William Mougayar.

Since OpenBazaar has no intermediaries and no built in mechanisms for stopping a transaction from taking place, critics say it could become an ideal marketplace for stolen goods and illegal drugs—sort of a decentralized version of Silk Road. Hoffman isn't concerned. ""If we work hard to allow users to self-police, to do things legally, properly, easily, cheaply,"" he says, ""they will rush in and overwhelm whatever could possibly come in from the dark side of the internet.""

Approximately 9 minutes.

zmRnaJ-WBhQ,2014-09-22T17:39:05.000Z,UCIVMBvs03h74NSdQMH31jKA,The Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement (CKFTA),"Transcript:
Canada has negotiated the Canada-Korea
         Free Trade Agreement.
         It is projected to boost our economy by $1.7 billion,
         creating thousands of jobs for hard-working Canadians.
         It will also serve as a gateway into
         the larger Asia-Pacific region.
         Meet Bill Wymenga and Bruce Pollock,
         two Canadian business people who will benefit.
         This is what they have to say about the
         Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement.
         I&apos;m a pork producer here in Chatham-Kent.
         I produce market hogs for Conestoga Meats.
         Our company is an exporter of structural building materials -
         lumber and panel products that go to overseas markets,
         mainly the Pacific Rim.
         In our case, we&apos;ve figured that this would be worth
         about five dollars per hog.
         If I ship twenty-two hundred market hogs a year,
         that&apos;s over ten thousand just in my own personal pocket, and
         I&apos;m not a very large producer so this is very significant.
         If you add that number across Canada where we have
         over 21 million hogs, that are marketed per year,
         we&apos;re talking something over a 100 million dollars.
         The tariff for products from America are 7.2%, ours are 8%.
         When we look at what&apos;s going to happen over the next five years,
         because of the U.S. Free Trade Agreement with Korea,
         theirs will drift to zero and ours will stay the same.
         How can we compete with an 8% disadvantage?
         The South Korean market has been very important
         for us in the past.
         It&apos;s been one of our top five markets that we export
         our product into and it&apos;s a valuable market for us.
         We want to have the same opportunities that other
         companies enjoy in other countries.
         Nothing says long-term than having your federal government
         involved to help strike a free trade agreement to ensure
         your competitiveness in the marketplace.
         With the landmark Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement now
         concluded, Canadian businesses and workers - people like Bill
         Wymenga and Bruce Pollock - will benefit significantly
         from increased market access to one of the most
         dynamic markets in Asia.
         Make South Korea your market.
         Your gateway to Asia.

DENPASAR, INDONESIA — An eruption from Bali’s Mount Agung volcano is imminent. Authorities have evacuated some 75,000 people in danger zones surrounding areas.

2. EARTH — A volcano is an opening in the earth’s surface where molten rock can escape. The earth’s crust is made up of tectonic plates that shift and move. Volcanoes are often located at the fault lines between these plates. 

3. LAS VEGAS — At least 59 people were killed and 527 injured when a sniper opened fire at a Las Vegas concert on Sunday night. 

4. LAS VEGAS — The man behind Sunday night’s atrocity had nearly 2 dozen weapons in his hotel, including rifles modified with a bump stock.

5. BARCELONA — On October 1, 2017, Catalonia voted for independence, despite massive opposition from the central Spanish government.

Our KAL cartoonist illustrates the state of trade in our latest offering, ""Daily Watch""

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 

From the time we are children, we swap things with others. We give and take for mutual benefit. This same principle of exchange and enrichment is what motivates trade between countries.

Trade is widely regarded as a spur for economic growth. It encourages countries to specialise in certain areas of strength. This enables the world to produce more goods and more kinds of goods than it otherwise could.

Since World War II, international trade has increased seventeen-fold, helping to ignite economic growth around the globe. Despite the obvious benefits of free trade, there are many who are motivated to limit it. 

Tariffs, trade bans and quota restrictions can be used as weapons to punish competing and opposing nations. This could lead to retaliation and a devastating trade war. 

Some critics argue that not all trade is good trade. Trading with poor developing countries where wages are usually lower and working hours longer than in developed countries can create an imbalance. The result can be the loss of jobs in high wage economies.

Despite these concerns, free and open trade should be embraced. Embracing the alternative is child's play.

Actress Jessica Biel says she's not opposed to vaccinations, but she does not support a bill in California that would limit medical exemptions.
The 37-year-old has drawn criticism after appearing this week in Sacramento with vaccination skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to voice concerns about the measure.
Biel posted on Instagram Thursday (13JUNE2019)morning that she supports children getting vaccinated and she also supports families having the ``right to make educated medical decisions for their children alongside their physicians.'' 
Biel wrote that she argued against the bill because her friends have a child with a medical condition warranting an exemption and the bill would ``greatly affect their family's ability to care for their child.''
The bill follows a recent rise in cases of measles, mumps and other infectious diseases nationwide.

Earlier, local Catalan police intervened to form a barrier when a separatist threw purple paint on a man who was part of another march of around 100 people in support of Spanish police demanding better pay. Officers used batons to push back the oncoming separatists - who will mark the first anniversary of the 2017 referendum on Monday - and keep apart the opposing groups.

This isn't just something that's happening in the United States – it's happening throughout the world. Often, these outbreaks begin with unvaccinated people. They spread through them, too. Outbreaks occur because of a breakdown in herd immunity. That's the topic of this week's Healthcare Triage.

Vaccines work by presenting a foreign antigen to the immune system to evoke an immune response, but there are several ways to do this. Four main types are currently in clinical use:

    An inactivated vaccine consists of virus or bacteria that are grown in culture and then killed using a method such as heat or formaldehyde. Although the virus or bacteria particles are destroyed and cannot replicate, the virus capsid proteins or bacterial wall are intact enough to be recognized and remembered by the immune system and evoke a response. When manufactured correctly, the vaccine is not infectious, but improper inactivation can result in intact and infectious particles. Since the properly produced vaccine does not reproduce, booster shots are required periodically to reinforce the immune response.
    In an attenuated vaccine, live virus or bacteria with very low virulence are administered. They will replicate, but locally or very slowly. Since they do reproduce and continue to present antigen to the immune system beyond the initial vaccination, boosters may be required less often. These vaccines may be produced by passaging, for example, adapting a virus into different host cell cultures, such as in animals, or at suboptimal temperatures, allowing selection of less virulent strains, or by mutagenesis or targeted deletions in genes required for virulence. There is a small risk of reversion to virulence, which is smaller in vaccines with deletions. Attenuated vaccines also cannot be used by immunocompromised individuals. Reversions of virulence were described for a few attenuated viruses of chickens (infectious bursal disease virus, avian infectious bronchitis virus, avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus [3], avian metapneumovirus [4])[21]
    Virus-like particle vaccines consist of viral protein(s) derived from the structural proteins of a virus. These proteins can self-assemble into particles that resemble the virus from which they were derived but lack viral nucleic acid, meaning that they are not infectious. Because of their highly repetitive, multivalent structure, virus-like particles are typically more immunogenic than subunit vaccines (described below). The human papillomavirus and Hepatitis B virus vaccines are two virus-like particle-based vaccines currently in clinical use.
    A subunit vaccine presents an antigen to the immune system without introducing viral particles, whole or otherwise. One method of production involves isolation of a specific protein from a virus or bacterium (such as a bacterial toxin) and administering this by itself. A weakness of this technique is that isolated proteins may have a different three-dimensional structure than the protein in its normal context, and will induce antibodies that may not recognize the infectious organism. In addition, subunit vaccines often elicit weaker antibody responses than the other classes of vaccines.

A number of other vaccine strategies are under experimental investigation. These include DNA vaccination and recombinant viral vectors. Source of the article published in description is Wikipedia. I am sharing their material. Copyright by original content developers of Wikipedia.
